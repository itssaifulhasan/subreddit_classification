Coronavirus vs. Cinema Workers,"Hi guys,

Not really sure where else to put this but, yeah, wanted to start a thread for the out of work cinema staff to discuss what‚Äôs going on.

I work (worked) at Odeon in the UK, today was my last day for sometime, the past three days have been spent throwing away stock and deep cleaning the cinema. We were not told by management in advance that Odeon was going to close, it was announced on Twitter, and after badgering our manager he told us we were still rota‚Äôd to come in until our last shifts. 

We haven‚Äôt heard anything from head office regarding pay or job security at all, so, next week we‚Äôll be getting this months pay, and then, well, we don‚Äôt really know what‚Äôs going on. Not even the managers do.

More stories/advice would be appreciated.",movies,1584586115,happynessisgone,8,5,True,2020-03-18

Interstellar‚Äôs Foreshadowing,"Nolan‚Äôs The Prestige is always talked about when it comes to his use of foreshadowing. However, I think it‚Äôs something he abuses in all of his movies to play with time, a reoccurring motif in a lot of his movies. 

One instance, which I just caught after maybe the fifth watching of Interstellar, is the first instance of dialogue. As Cooper wakes up from his flight dream Murph says ‚ÄúI thought you were the ghost.‚Äù Obviously by the end of the movie it‚Äôs clear he is definitely the ghost. 

I wonder if the amount of foreshadowing Nolan uses in his films is a staple to his style and the general enjoyment of his films. It definitely adds to the fullness that his films feel.",movies,1584590957,1003mistakes,5,1,True,2020-03-19

The Endless - Still Some Questions,"Just re-watched The Endless and I'm still very confused ...

The guy that hangs himself get to keep his dead body from one of the loops? How? And how exactly does the reset work? Doesn't it literally put everything back into its original place? Why's there blood on the motorcycle after he kills himself with a gun? Is that not a loop? And he can visit other loops?

How come only the brothers can walk from one loop to the other (if the guy who hangs himself can't)? Some say it's because they are trapped inside a larger loop = large loop people can visit loops inside their loop?

What are the chances of a Streaming crash happening in the same vein as the Video game crash of 1983?,"For the uneducated, the video game crash of 1983 was a time of recession in the video game industry in the USA that was caused due to market saturation of game consoles and available games, plus waning interest in console games in favor of personal computers. It wasn't until the success of the NES (Nintendo Entertainment System) in 1985 that console gaming was able to get back to its feet. However as years went by, this lead to more companies pulling out of the console market with as of now only 3 mainstream companies being in the market with consoles that aren't from Microsoft, Sony or Nintendo either being discontinued or being super obscure. Now what does this have to do with streaming, I just want to clarify that these are my opinions and I would like to hear yours.

Its seems by around 2023, every media company is going to have their own streaming platform and it is only a matter of time before cable TV is completely dead. However some of these platforms especially when it comes to TV and Movies, don't have much to offer other than maybe 1 or 3 good shows. They are many good shows and movies being overloked because their is way to many streaming platform that people have to subscribe to just to watch that one show and never use the platform again. As we have seen in the news, this has lead to are rise in piracy and streaming has made it much easier. The Mandalorian was voted the most pirated show in 2019, and it is only a matter time before people get so overwhelmed by so many streaming platforms that they decide to start watching illegally. That's the thing this whole approach that companies have of taking their ball and going home (or in this case taking their properties and making it into its own streaming service you have to pay for every month) it's so ridiculous. When it was just basically Hulu and Netflix things were simple and easy. Now you basically need a diagram to show you where various shows are. Of course that doesn't bother me or my many new privateer friends Yar har.

Jokes aside, I feel there will be a massive streaming crash akin to the gaming crash of 83 due to too many services in the near future. Do I want it to happen? Well Hopefully this would lead to 3-4 services being the main stay similar to only having 3 consoles and PC, but that's just my selfishness. I just don't people have the patience to pay and monitor different platform when cable allowed them to have different channels under one cervices.",movies,1584597317,KensukeTanabe,12,1,True,2020-03-19

The Final Ultimate Last List of All the Best Bottle Films Ever,"Over the last few years I've realized that ""bottle films"" are some of my favorite.  For those that aren't familiar with that term, they are movies that are usually characterized by small sets (often a single room), small casts, lower budgets, and a lot of dialogue.  On paper they sound pretty boring, but the good ones are carried by intriguing ideas, plus very strong writing and lead performances.    

My understanding of what qualifies as a bottle film has widened somewhat over the years, and I've never seen a really comprehensive list of the best films in this genre.  So I wanted to try and make one, and see if anybody has some good ones to add to it.

*(no particular order, personal bests in bold)*

**Man From Earth**

**12 Angry Men**

**Bug**

**Exam**

**Sunset Limited**

**Moon**

For a good while in it seems like just another generic straight to DVD B-Movie (though it is genuinely a pretty scary movie, better than most I would say) but you'll understand how well written and detailed the whole thing was once you hit the last 5 minutes. It's a plot twist that you won't see from a mile away and the movie is very self aware in it's execution, and it's clear that they wrote minor every detail of the bulk of the movie around that twist, to the point that rewatching the movie again is a whole different ballgame because you can pay attention to where every detail fit and how it was planned out. It's surprising that the movie was released straight to DVD in the states because it was really well written and deserves some attention.

"Non-Smokers - Do you find smoking to be a turn-off in leading characters? If so, should film-makers be concerned?","One of the objectives in most films involving romance is to emotionally entangle the viewer with the leading characters so that the feel immersed and moved by the fictional relationship‚Äôs ups and downs.  Obviously this is why film makers invest so much effort in building the attractiveness of the main characters so that we the viewers are more readily attached to the characters and to the film.

But film makers seem to find it difficult to kick the smoking habit.  Does this not risk alienating audience members who are not smokers?

Personally, I find smoking to be a huge turn-off.  My family has suffered tragic consequences due to smoking and this has affected me all my life.  Perhaps I am more sensitive to this habit than most people.

In films, I find myself emotionally distanced from any leading lady who is a smoker ... repulsed, really.  Even more so if the film maker goes out of the way to shove the smoking in our face as if it were something sexy or uses it as a filmic crutch for emotional expressiveness.

Given that smoking is very much a minority habit (among Americans, anyway), shouldn‚Äôt film makers be more wary of contaminating their lead characters with this affectation?

Perhaps I am more negatively moved by this than most Americans.  But I‚Äôm curious what others think.  I‚Äôm also curious to know what film makers (and execs) really think about how smoking in films is really perceived among the general audience and whether they worry about this much?  

Given that they have great concern about their attractiveness and appeal to as broad a fanbase as possible, do actors have any reluctance to being seen smoking on the screen?

It is not my intention to offend anyone.  My apologies if I have.  I am only interested in open and honest discussion.  

Anyway, thanks for any insights that you might share.",movies,1584608990,Captain_Rational,17,1,True,2020-03-19
Searching for Another Movie-- animated Barbie-like movie w/ theme park,"Hello! I've made a lot of posts here searching for movies and I was hoping that you lovely people could help me again!

So today's movie is either a computer animated movie or a traditionally animated one

I thought it was Barbie, but when I looked through the list of Barbie movies, none of them matched the description of what I remember. And it can't be Barbie: Life in the Dreamhouse either because the dates don't match up. I watched it after 2007, but it may be older or younger, but it can't be from 2016 and up

The plot sort of goes like this: a bunch of girls are in a limousine and they pull up to a theme park \[sort of\]. Inside the limousine, they get makeovers and everything \[there are like machines for clothes and makeup and stuff\] 

They exit and look all nice and really pretty. There were like maybe 6 girls? One of them is all ""this is my theme park guys! it's based after me!"" or something of that sort, but the theme park is based after her and her and her group of friends have make overs and prepare for some sort of event I think. There may or may not be a concert in the end?

But the main antagonist is this catty girl named Raquelle or something that sounds similar \[she screams it out in the end and basically embarrasses herself in front of someone\] and that's all I remember. I think she continually tries to sabotage the main group of girls, but that's it.

Rant: Bond movies are amazing (message to the producers to not make it a Bondess),"Please just let me rant it out a bit.

Daniel Craig's bond movies are amazing, and much more than a fun watch. It follows tradition, while taking itself slightly more seriously. Although categorised as a blockbuster, it doesn't make sense to fit them in the same category as Marvel movies or Dwayne Johnson movies. It can best be compared to Mission Impossible or John Wick, but takes itself a bit more seriously than they do (I love MI and John Wick too). 

It's more of a car guy's film, than the actual Fast and the Furious franchise (utter shit, I would rather listen to a farmer rant about the weather). Bond films have the tradition for cars, women, fashion and action. It's just an experience to watch the movie at the cinemas, the 007-barrel sequences, the song and animation for the opening credits, the quips (fine, these can be a bit overdone, maybe cut back on that a bit), the flamboyant villains, the location, bond girls and femme fatales, the gadgets and tech. A lot goes into planning all of these, unlike the numerous CGI-infested bullshit that comes out.

This is one of the few franchises that are left with a genuine man's man character. We don't everything to be switched based on what's trending. Make a new series with a female lead, but please leave Bond films as its own series. This is one of the few (possibly only?) series that goes back to my maternal grandfather watching it during his 20s and 30s. He used to work for the Intelligence and went on operations around the world (taking my mum and her siblings when they were kids). I am sure there are many others out there who have their grandparents watching these films and be a part of their memories. When you change the character, you are not just playing with the franchise, but you are playing with people's memories.",movies,1584614072,MeLikesPineapples,39,1,True,2020-03-19

"Who are some accomplished actors/directors that came from poor, working class or non-trained backgrounds?","Here in the UK, there is often thought and feeling around the creative industries, particularly arts and drama, that there is underrepresentation and can be very tough for poor or working class or non-trained actors to make something of themselves and become successful and accomplished within film.

Usually points at the combination of struggling to support oneself while trying to gain training and experience, getting a foot in the door within theatre and film, breaking out of typecast roles and so on - which all become much easier and comfortable for the children of the wealthy and industry connected to achieve. And I am sure this is a similar case in other parts of the world.

What movie character you hate the most?,"For me, It's no doubt **Paris** from **Troy (2004)**. Now, I know that this movie doesn't portray the Trojan War exactly as we know it from Greek mythology, but man how much I hate him for his actions.

First he spits in the face of his father and whole Troy city just to bring his love Helen home. I get it, if you love someone you can do radical things, but putting in danger your family and whole nation for the one woman is just so selfish.

Secondly THE COWARDNESS of this man. That scene where he crawls back to his brother Hector to avoid death, which not only he did totally deserve, but triggered the Greek army to attack trojans, after Hector killed Menelaus, which again caused many deaths. He should've take it like a real prince, how did Helen, presumably the most beautiful woman in the world at this time, even fell love with this kid? (Note that I am telling it from the movie POV, I know that originally it was Aphrodite, who made Helen fell in love with him). Also, when fights occured, he was just sitting through them on the throne with Helen (didn't see him in any fight scene), such a *brave* man.

And to top it all off - the last scene where he started to blast his arrows into Achilles FROM THE BACK, when Achilles didn't even saw it coming. *So badass*, man. Yeah, Achilles would kill this kid if he would saw him and he was trying to protect Briseis, but why not hearing out Briseis, who was shouting to stop? Was it a from a massive anger towards Achilles? I don't know, but either way, Paris got my titel for the most hated person from movie. Who got yours?",movies,1584618979,DoctorSnaut,50,1,True,2020-03-19

Thanos and his inevitableness,"Thinking of Thanos‚Äô statement ‚ÄúI am inevitable.‚Äù has me thinking about his meaning in the Avengers movies on a deeper level.  Thanos‚Äô name is derived from Thanatos who was the God of non-violent deaths and Thanatos translates to death.  Death is inevitable for all mortal beings and is their ultimate fate.  By beating Thanos, the Avengers exhibit the concept of self-determination, that our lives are not always ruled by fate/destiny.  In real life, even if some things like death are inevitable at some point, we have choices to make actions that can improve our lives and the lives of those around us.  People who view life as predestined and unchangeable  often feel depressed, while those who make the choice to change for the better are happier and inspire hope.  Thanos viewed the eventual depletion of resources as fate and speeding up the destined deaths of half of universal beings was the way to slow the use of resources.",movies,1584621847,mvs1_77,1,1,True,2020-03-19

Please help me find this movie from mid 90's to early 00's.," So I've been struggling to find this movie for a long time. I know it's from around 1995-2005, and that the story also is within the same time period. What I do have is the riff of one song in the movie, and a general concept of the story of the movie. I also know there was a soundtrack/album that was from the band portrayed in the movie. Not sure if the band was fictional or not.

The story follows a pop rock/grunge band that get the possibility to produce an album. Part of the movie is in the studio recording the album. I vaguely remember there are some arguments between the band members during the movie. I have the idea that both the band and the music are very similar to Weezer and Wheatus. I also know this is probably very much a ""straight to tv""-movie, and that there most likely are no proper known actors in it. I was at one point sure the name of the movie was ""Mr. Music"", but it's not. It might be something similar though. I vaguely remember the vocalist to have glassed, but that might not be true.  

I had the album for the longest time, but several years ago I gave away all of my cd's :(

Please help! :)

Martin Campbell's direction was impeccable. His overall tone for the movie was pitch perfect.

Eva Green, Dame Judi, Tobias Menzies, Jeffrey Wright and of course, Mads Mikkelsen were an outstanding supporting cast.

Why is nobody excited for SCOOB!,"https://youtu.be/GzlEnS7MmUo 

I certainly am, yes the voice acting is a little off, but they at least got Scoobys voice right &amp; the animation looks good. Plus it is crossing over with the Blue Falcon &amp; will be the start of a Hanna Barbra Cinematic Universe, which to me just sounds awesome. Also it still feels like Scooby Doo.

You still have Shaggy &amp; Scooby, the Mystery Inc. Gang working together to solve crimes and such, them stopping and evil Baddie with a dastardly plan, etc. So in my books this look extremely promising, and I see not reason for why people are NOT excited.

If in Happy Gilmore, Happy traveled to real-life Adam Sandler's house and knocked on the door, one of two tings would have to happen:

1 - There would not be an Adam Sandler in that house because he doesn't exist, forcing an alternate reality situation which would force the movie to be scifi.

"Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011) is one of the best rom-com drama I've ever seen.","As in this tough time when all of us are staying home. I am discovering new movies and also on a Emma Stone marathon. So after watching Battle of the Sexes next on the line was Crazy, Stupid, Love. which I never thought of watching because I thought of it as a simple Rom-com story so it never getted my attention. But man I was wrong. I go in expecting a simple rom-com
&amp; this movie just blowed all my excpectations. 
All of the actors were well casted. Steve Carell was always nailing the part of Cal. Ryan Gosling charm was on another level in this movie. Emma Stone was cute like always, Julian Moore was great. Kevin Bacon &amp; Marisa Tomei was really funny in the screentime they were given. The kid playing Carell's son was very impresseive. I don't want to go into the spoiler territory but the whole movie takes a lot of twists &amp; turns &amp; the last 30 minutes were In the Babysitter's word 'batshit crazy'!

Why do wome movies have black bars even in the movie theaters?,"I was told that at home I see black bars on movies because they were filmed in an aspect ratio to accommodate the wider screens the movies are shown on at a movie theater. 16:9 has become the standard for today's displays at home. However I was surprised that when I saw Star Wars: Rise Of The Skywalker it still had black bars in the theater. 

The only thing I could think of is that it's because I saw it on the last week before it was pulled from the theater due to digital release. Maybe all of the rooms are not equal at the AMC I was at and perhaps could have been a 16:9 screen as it looked smaller to me. I am thinking if I see a newer movie or even better an IMAX movie it would not have the black bars.

I was watching Rango today, and I noticed a similarity between that movie, Monsters, Inc. and the second and third Toy Story; they all have a powerful character who at first seems good, is warm and welcoming to the protagonist, and genuinely believes he is doing good, but ends up being revealed as corrupt (those being the mayor, Mr. Waternoose, the Prospector and Lotso, respectively). In all examples, the character is also big and round, probably contributing their initially perceived warmth.

The Oscars Were So White and Male back in 2011. Where was the backlash then?,"Outside of one CNN article, there was hardly any backlash when the 2011 Academy Awards came and all the acting nominees where white and the directors were all male, despite two of the Best Picture nominees, The Kids Are All Right and Winter‚Äôs Bone being directing by Lisa Cholodenko and Debra Granik, respectively. No attention was brought up about how they were snubbed but there was when Christopher Nolan was.

This is exactly why I can‚Äôt take Hollywood seriously. They pride themselves as being liberal and progressive when they‚Äôre just massive hypocrites. Hell, this year‚Äôs Oscars were far more diverse than 2011‚Äôs, and there‚Äôs more backlash for the former. That‚Äôs just hilarious. If they truly cared, there would‚Äôve been more films by minorities and women made after the 2011 Oscars brought up that issue. But nope. It was until after the 2015 Oscars did they get the backlash.

Me personally, inclusivity is important for cinema. We get to see new perspectives and kids get to see themselves on screen. This goes beyond awards or success. If Hollywood actually cared, there would be a lot more diverse voices than just a few each year.[Where's the diversity at the Oscars?](edition.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/26/diversity.academy.awards/?hpt=C2)",movies,1581991519,HBarnill,38,1,True,2020-02-17
Portrait of a Lady on Fire was just simply intoxicating. Please go see it if it is playing in a theater near you.,"Opinions are opinions, but I do echo other sentiments in that France made a mistake in submitting Les Miserables to be their best foreign language Oscar pic rather than Portrait of a Lady on Fire. As a connoisseur of French Cinema, it was not only the best French Film in a while but one of the best movies I've seen recently.

At the very least this movie deserved a nomination for best cinematography. The lighting of this movie in conjunction with the colors of the costumes, the environments, the framing, and the natural look of the actresses was nothing short of masterful. And while this movie moved slowly, I absolutely adored the way in which in built the relationship of the two protagonists. From a cold distant relationship, until they each knew every facet of each other's personality and nature. Up until that ending, absolutely poetic in which it closed an affair that was rather brief with respect to the lives of both protagonists but everlasting in terms of the impact it left on both of them. 

Easily one of the top 3 movies of 2019 for me. While Parasite may have had more audience appeal, being that rare movie that works as both an art-house film and a blockbuster, I do believe Portrait of a Lady on Fire deserves to be mentioned alongside it as a piece of pure cinema.",movies,1581991892,boondocks5,124,1,True,2020-02-17

I don't believe film's should have opening credits,"I've been thinking this for a long time but as the titles states, I don't think film's should have opening credits. 

It's so important for a film to grab you from the beginning and with the constant distraction  of the credits it basically tell me 'You don't need to concentrate at this part'.

I've noticed Christopher Nolan's last few (at least) have had no opening credits and it works so well. From literally the first second you are in the movie without distraction. I realise people have worked hard behind the scenes but that's what the closing credits are for and people who want to know more will watch them. No point jamming them in the eyes of the movie goer at the expense of the film.

Things like James Bond are interesting and slightly different as that's part of the franchise. People probably don't care either way and that's fair enough but thought I'd just share my opinion",movies,1581994301,dat89,17,1,True,2020-02-17

"Just saw Menace 2 Society for the first time and it crushed me. Was a cautionary tale about karma and leaving the ghetto, or valuing your own life enough to save it?","I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it. The whole thing was just devastating, and the ending is sticking with me. Caine suffered so much in death, his performance and the direction was really raw.

I know Caine wasn‚Äôt a good person; he robbed, assaulted, attempted murder(A-Wax killed Caine‚Äôs target), and treated Ilena like trash, but it still made me incredibly sad when he died in such a self-aware and painful manner.
I don‚Äôt put all the blame on Caine. His parents were monsters that brought him into a very toxic home that would have permanent effects on anyone. Almost all of his friends embraced the criminal lifestyle to different degrees, which can apply pressure to fit in, most notably when Caine was apprehensive about getting revenge for his cousin and O-Dog wouldn‚Äôt let him off. 

Even though characters like Ronnie and Sharif were set on leaving the ghetto, it didn‚Äôt really seem like the point of the story for me. He never spoke of any plans to gain financial means to move away, or any dreams of what could be beyond the ghetto. Caine never seemed interested in leaving, in the end I feel he wanted to go to Atlanta more for Anthony, and not for himself.
The movie‚Äôs point to me was that Caine never valued HIS OWN LIFE, or anybody else‚Äôs, which is what ultimately led to horrible decisions and actions, which led to his death. He wasn‚Äôt upset that the Asian store owners lost their lives and that their families would be devastated, he just didn‚Äôt want to get caught and put in jail for the crime. Sure you could say that the film‚Äôs overall message is that of karma, that your poor choices and actions have consequences, but I felt the stronger one was best spoken in Caine‚Äôs final thought, ‚Äúmy grandpa asked me one time if I care whether I live or die. Yeah, I do. Now it's too late.‚Äù
Did anyone else feel this way? I can‚Äôt stop thinking about this movie. I‚Äôve seen Boyz N The Hood, and it didn‚Äôt bother me emotionally nearly as much as Menace 2 Society.",movies,1582000606,eddietwoo,1,1,True,2020-02-17

"Question about the different cliques and ethnic or religious groups, so to speak, in The Irishman","It was hard to follow who was who. You had Catholic Italian mob, Jewish mob, you had Catholic Italian mob that was pro-Kennedy until the Bay of Pigs, then I guess they turned on him but why, did President Johnson help them get their casinos back from Cuba either? No, that I know of. At least JFK could have tried again a couple years later, no? Many Americans died, Castro was taunting America, he could have used that as an excuse to go after Cuba again. ""We cannot let this stand!"" etc. I'm not advocating that JFK should have invaded Cuba in the first place let alone a second time, I am anti-war, I'm just saying from the perspective of the mobsters who had casinos in Havana, I don't get it. 

Basically who did Hoffa represent, ethnically, religiously? I know he represented the Teamsters Union but beyond that I was lost.

Robert De Niro's character and Joe Pesci's character, were they both supposed to be Jewish? But then at the end they were going to Christian services/priests? That was confusing.

Were the Jewish ""washerwomen"" that turned out to be the Jewish mob, were any of them featured in the movie as characters? Or just an entity off screen that was working with the italians  through Harvey Keitel's character? 

If they knew it meant all of them going to jail why did they kill Hoffa? I thought they were killing him not just because they couldn't get along, but to avoid prison? But then right after, in the film, they all went to prison.

The Robert De Niro killing Hoffa scene was confusing because of how Pesci phrased what he told him. He told him ""I had to bring you into this"" or something otherwise I knew you wouldn't let it happen, but it's going to happen. It was unclear if he meant tell you about this and keep you away, put you on an airplane in the air so you can't get mobile on the ground and stop the killing, or if he meant De Niro had to be the one to kill Hoffa. It wasn't clear if the airplane was meant to go to where Hoffa was (Detroit I think) and kill him, or if De Niro got on the plane, waited for Pesci to drive away, then forced the pilot to turn around and land back where they were, then got in a car and drove to where Hoffa was in an effort to stop the killing. But then when Hoffa kept looking for reasons to insult every mobster he came into contact with, De Niro realized Hoffa was beyond saving because even if he saved him that day, he would just continue to act antagonistically to everyone and get killed later on anyway. So then to hide his tracks did De Niro tell the driver the wrong house, some empty house (how'd he know it was unlocked), so he could kill Hoffa and make it look like he was never there, or something, like he was never planning on going against Pesci's wishes? And somehow got the two drivers not to tell anyone?

Or was it as simple as Pesci put him on a plane to go kill Hoffa, and that's what he did, and that was the house picked out by Pesci?",movies,1582001440,redditrando250,18,1,True,2020-02-17

In that time I had probably watched the movie 15 times. And needless to say I grew tired of it.

"Sonic The Hedgehog Proves That, Sometimes, Fans DO Know Better","&amp;#x200B;

[ Without fans pushing back, we'd have gotten the left design instead of the right. ](https://preview.redd.it/dcjmijpqkmh41.png?width=618&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2893bdc93700a5df8d02a740c7a3a79cdda5eacf)

&amp;#x200B;

Youtuber Lily Orchard/Peet once did a video (I forget exactly which) about criticism of modern *Star Wars*, saying something to the effect of ""Fans do NOT know better than professional storytellers.""

&amp;#x200B;

I wonder how she'd feel about that statement in retrospect after the critical &amp; box office performance of 2020's *Sonic the Hedgehog* (though I've rarely if ever seen her acknowledge when she's wrong).

&amp;#x200B;

As an artist and amateur filmmaker myself, I understand that creative freedom is important. You can never please everyone, because fans want different things. No fandom, however big, is a hive mind.

&amp;#x200B;

Fundamentally, there wouldn't be much point to adapting anything if it were a beat-for-beat carbon copy of the source material. To expect any adaptation to do this is ultimately an unrealistic standard.

&amp;#x200B;

There needs to be some level of flexibility for writers &amp; directors to take creative liberties with a property to tell their story. At the same time, however, there must be respect for the source material.

&amp;#x200B;

Even if/when drastic changes are made, you can still execute them in a way that fits organically &amp; stays faithful to the characters/lore (specifically, the aspects that made them appealing to begin with).

&amp;#x200B;

They aren't mutually exclusive, contrary to how some seem to think, it's simply a balancing act. Like any form of entertainment, there's a spectrum for how much is too little or too far for adaptations.

&amp;#x200B;

And every IP differs to some extent in where exactly it falls on the line for fans. The trick is listening to input and testing the waters for a general consensus if there is one (More often than not, there is).

&amp;#x200B;

Make time and put in effort in to research what the majority want from an adaptation of an IP, even if it means reviewing fan-fiction (Contrary to stereotyping, some fan-fics are professionally well written).

&amp;#x200B;

Then, take what you've learned about boundaries you may not want to cross and account for that in developing your narrative. It doesn't take an expert or veteran to understand a principle this basic.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't need to be an accomplished director to have enough basic sense that I can see how/why Sonic fans generally reacted negatively to the first trailer's design. I pay attention, that's how it all starts.

&amp;#x200B;

The issue is partially woke media's proclivity for writing off substantiated criticisms as ""whining, man-babies, entitlement, unpleasable, sexist, racist, nostalgia-blind"" and other strawman-generalizations.

&amp;#x200B;

It's a classic tactic used since long before this generation, over-simplifying &amp; misrepresenting the other side in order to undermine arguments you'd otherwise have no rebuttal against.

&amp;#x200B;

It's always easier to vilify someone than to debate them. I've seen this exact same pattern in countless other examples (modern *Star Wars*, *Ghostbusters* (2016), *Suicide Squad*, *DB Super*, etc), since I was a kid.

&amp;#x200B;

When you favor what came before, you're wearing rose-tinted goggles because ""it's all subjective"". If you dislike what you're given, you're prejudiced in some way or ""just don't get it"". See the trend yet?

&amp;#x200B;

It's a series of convenient deflections, blanket-statements and buzz-words for the explicit purpose of undervaluing fans' opinions even when they can back them up with reason, logic, and experience.

&amp;#x200B;

In the case of Sonic, we saw the whole arsenal. If you dislike the first design, you're nostalgia-blind. If the studio changes the design, they're giving into bullying and catering toward whiny man-babies.

&amp;#x200B;

If you support this, you're part of the problem. If you go see this movie instead of *Birds of Prey*, you're sexist, misogynist, etc. And now that *Sonic*'s successful, the blame is once again on us for that.

&amp;#x200B;

Because how dare we voice an opinion on something we don't like and are then proven right when the new design improves feedback. Even now, the media continues to pretend fans don't deserve praise.

&amp;#x200B;

We were wrong to point out how such radical changes to one of the MOST INFLUENTIAL CHARACTERS IN ALL OF FICTION backfired, and the studio was wrong to make objectively beneficial corrections.

&amp;#x200B;

There's no evidence that the movie would've made a cent less with the original design (except, you know, the substantial like/dislike ratio on the initial trailer), and fans still shouldn't be taken seriously.

&amp;#x200B;

The bottom line is that, like it or not, what fans want DOES matter. I'm not suggesting studios &amp; writers should follow us blindly, nor that we should blindly be grateful for whatever we're given.

&amp;#x200B;

We need to stop allowing this mentality of thinking in extremes to drive the dialogue. That prevents us from really having a dialogue instead of yelling and trading ""Gotcha's"" to make ourselves feel better.

&amp;#x200B;

When we don't communicate and open our pov to others', nobody wins. When studios &amp; media let their pride blind them and keep trying to demonize us, they only expose their own ignorance.

&amp;#x200B;

And when fans' input is ignored or condescended to, adaptations suffer. The longer this inarguable fact keeps getting pushed back against, the more such stubbornness will only make it more evident.",movies,1582006975,harriskeith29,1,1,True,2020-02-18

They're rich and not from the hood, and didn't die like Black characters in horror movies. I like how the son's name is Jason and wears a mask, and his mom is the villain which is a reference to the first Friday the 13th movie.

The actors got to play ""typical"" scary movie villains that I don't see many as colored. The things I liked about their Tethered are Red is a strong leader, Umbrae was born evil and has a creepy smile like those creepy little girls, and Pluto looks like a serial killer icon. Another reference could be that Pluto and Jason are a reference to the movie Freddy vs. Jason because Pluto has a burnt face and dies in fire like Freddy.

Which Andrei Tarkovsky film do you guys recommend to watch first?,[removed],movies,1582020529,uhh_h,0,1,True,2020-02-18
"What happened to Owen Kline, the 12 year son in The Squid and the Whale?","I thought he was fantastic and one of the standouts of this film. He‚Äôs Kevin Kline‚Äôs son so it‚Äôs not particularly shocking he got the role, but I think he proved he was more than just a kid with a connection. 

It looks like after this film he just stopped working. I‚Äôm just curious why. 

The film is on Netflix US if anyone wants to watch it, I totally recommend it.",movies,1582020584,galaxikk,1,1,True,2020-02-18
Attack of the Clones was the best film of the Prequels Trilogy,"For me, it was the one Star Wars movie of that trilogy that felt like a true Star Wars film. It had a straight-forward narrative, some amazing light-saber fights like the one involving Obi Wan Kenobi and Boba Fett's dad in the sea planet or Yoda battling out with Christopher Lee. Those fight scenes are truly up there. And while some people hated the romantic subplot, I actually liked it. I thought Hayden Christenssen and Natalie Portman (who has never looked better) made for a cute couple and I believed their bond. And I also liked that Padme got to do something in this movie. In Phantom and Revenge, she didn't do shit but cry and be a clothes horse, but here she was being a bad ass action star in the same vein as Princess Leia. 

Christenssen often gets criticized for his acting as Anakin here but like did you guys forget how bad Mark Hamill was in the OG trilogy. If anything, Christenssen was being faithful to that wooden style of acting and besides, Ewan MacGregor and Nat Portman made up for it. 

And you had so many amazing epic action scenes: the chase sequence when a killer tried to murder Padme in her sleep, the Arena Jedi battle. I mean, there's nothing in Phantom or Revenge that rivals those two moments, in my opinion. 

I didn't like Phantom because it took itself too seriously, Jar Jar Binks and a convoluted plot and Revenge was too dark and a downer. And Christenssen was too green to carry that entire movie whereas in AOTC, he was better as part of an ensemble. 

I still don't get why people see Attack as the worst. It seemed like the one movie that was closest to a sci-fi serial which is what George Lucas was going for.",movies,1582020654,Vivian_Bloomsbury,23,1,True,2020-02-18

Your opinions about Christmas in August (1998),"I'm not farmiliar with Korean culture nor its film industry. But I encoutered Christmas in August (1998, dir. Jin ho Hur) a few days ago and it struck me hard. I have been thinking about it ever since but couldn't think straight.

This is not just about only love affair or only death. I'm in a mess of thinking here. Jung-won could have explained everything to Darim, he could have asked his sister or best friend to deliver his letter to her (would she ever receive it?). Why Darim saw her portrait hung in the shop window, smiled and walked away? She knew that he came back, right? but he didn't meet her. Why didn't she angry anymore? She no longer love him or what?
I really need some of your opinions/explanations about the movie (especially the ending).

"Can someone explain to me why some critics accuse ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" of being either de-gayed or not gay enough?","Because the whole movie seems to be about Freddie Mercury trying to accept his sexual orientation. If anything, what the movie is guilty of is ignoring Freddie's bisexuality. It ignores the fact that he was in relationships with more women than just Mary. Instead the film keeps insisting Freddie is with Mary because he loves her on a spiritual level and yet he's attracted to men until he falls for Jim, a guy who teaches him gay relationships aren't just about sex but love. 

Yet if I were to read reviews, you'd think this movie paints Freddie as straight and that the whole film revolves around him being in love with Mary.",movies,1582024806,Girlina_Gayolina,13,1,True,2020-02-18

Christian bale gave one his best performance in ford Vs Ferrari.,I watched this in cinema last year but watched again on bluray this week. Man this guy has steeped his game so much. I have been always an avid fan of him. He is probably one of the best method actor out their. Machinist made me his fan and after that he has lots of amazing movie performances. I found this movie acting to be somewhat similar as in The Fighter (for which he won academy award) . The physique is so much similar. For me he is the best supporting actor of 2019. I won't go into oscars snubbing him out of the galaxy. Brad Pitt was due for his Oscar for acting and this was the right time to do it. I see awards more as political and personal agendas which is fine and these are not be taken seriously. I am asking how many of you felt exactly the same i felt that he is top supporting actor of 2019. I just wanted to share my thoughts that's it.,movies,1582030322,lordofabyss,157,1,True,2020-02-18

WW II movies containing the bombardment of Nagasaki and Hiroshima,"Recently I've started watching WW II movies. I like them because it will give me a better understanding of history while enjoying a good movie. Some really good ones I've seen recently:

* Unbroken, movie about a US soldier who becomes a prisoner of war in Japan.
* The Photographer of Mauthausen, movie about a photographer inside a concentration camp.

All these movies are focused on a particular big event or a major subject in the WW II.

"""The Bye Bye Man"" Might Be the Most Incoherent Film I've Ever Seen","I love to watch shitty horror films, and there's a lot of em on Netflix, but I have yo say, this might be the worst movie I've ever seen. I would rather watch a Sci Fi film with no budget and no expectations than this pile.

It's so facinating to me just how much of a mess this film is; every time I leave finding more and more scenes that just make me scratch my head. A character will walk into a room, just say some incoherent babble, and walk out. 

Why does the brother bring an 8 year old child to a college party? Why does the psychic say, ""he makes you see things that arent there, like trains"" and then IMMEDIATELY stop the car to walk in front of a train? Why can't the black dude get a boner? Is that one of the Bye Bye Man's powers? Instant ED? Why is Ms. Watkins? Just why anything with her? Why does no one react to anything like an actual human being? I NEED TO KNOW!

World War Z is the best non-comedy zombie movie,"It's excellent. A well-crafted plot with a likeable protagonist. His motivation is never unclear, his reasoning is sound, and he seems like a good person that's easy to root for.   
If I could make one change, I'd just have this story done in the form of a trilogy.   
Move one deals with everything up to South Korea, movie two is the flight to Israel and ends with the plane crash, and movie deals with the discovery of the method to defeat the virus. I think there's enough story there that it wouldn't drag and I even think you could keep the same pacing as this movie. I think more time in Israel would have been especially interesting. Scenes where they show patrols and videos from the earliest time of infection.

"'Arrival' is an amazing movie, but there is something that I dont quite understand","Obviously spoilers from here on out. 

------

So the movie opens with what we think is one of Dr. Louise Banks's memories. As time progresses we get little glimpses into other memories as well. When the big plot twist comes, and we discover that she has actually been seeing glimpses of her future, its said to have been caused by learning the alien language. That because she was able to learn their language, she was able to perceive time on a non-linear scale. 

Is that the whole explanation, or is there something else to explain why she can view time on a non-linear scale. It seems like a bit of a stretch to say that learning an alien language allowed her to see the future. I know there is the quote in there somewhere along the lines of 'language shapes the way we perceive the world', but again, to say it shapes the way we are able to view time is a stretch.",movies,1579399958,musicandtacos,116,1,True,2020-01-18

Why gender swap movies fail.,"1. Too much focus is put on the film being feminist instead of the film simply being a good film. 
2. Taking an existing film and adding a female cast isn‚Äôt enough to create a good movie, the movie needs to be good in all aspects. 
3. A gender swap reboots is no where near as interesting and powerful as an original story built from the ground up. 
4. The casting is typically bad, there are so, so many good female actresses, but these reboots seem to always have the bad ones. 
5. These movies are typically BADLY written, the writing severely takes away from what the movie was and adds things that don‚Äôt fit. 
6. Audiences don‚Äôt want to watch movies directed by people that spit in their face, Elizabeth banks *cough* 
7. People want to watch movies for fun, not to have ideology rammed down their throats. 
8. They lack the artistic expression that went into the original movies. 
9. The directors create these movies for all the wrong reasons. 
10. No one wants to see movies that are recycled for the sake of feminism. People want to see original ideas. 

Anyone who has ever spent a lengthy amount of time watching cinema knows that women are excellent leads. We need original movies with good stories, not recycled movies pushing common knowledge.",movies,1579403930,Sekiroo3,4,1,True,2020-01-18

Good Will Hunting, Dead Poets Society, Insomnia, Hell, even in Mrs. Doubtfire, even though it's a comedy, it's actually pretty serious too, and he nailed the dramatic part of it, imo. I haven't seen Awakenings or The Fisher King. But he was hilarious in The Birdcage and I've seen some of his stand up and it's unbelievable how quick he was with comedy.

What are your thoughts regarding a Movie remake of the Call of Duty storyline franchise?,"I played call of duty as a kid and the story modes were awesome and made so much sense. 

The soundtracks that accompanied the gameplay gave it much better atmosphere.

Taken With Liam Neeson Is More Than Just One Scene (A Defense of Taken),"So I just finished watching _Taken,_ 2008, for the, oh, 8th time or so, roughly.         
I've noticed that, although the movie did well, and there were a few months there in which it seemed like everyone was talking about and quoting it, when people talk about the movie these days it's with the same derision as Independence Day (another movie I love) or Commando (a movie I consider to be boring, cliche drivel.)          

In trying to think of the specific reasons that this movie is good, and not a guilty pleasure (unlike, say, *London Has Fallen*) I found myself struggling a bit, since by the end of the movie I was so overwhelmed with the emotion of the final reunion of father and daughter that it's difficult to remember precisely what I was enjoying prior to it.         

Of course, that's exactly the answer: The fact that I _cared_ about their final reunion, that it felt significant and _earned_ is really the explanation for what's good about this movie and why so many other banal action snoozers either don't stand the test of time, or survive only as gags about machismo and some thin apology about being so terrible that it's come back around to good. (That's a rare honor, by my perception, that I will bestow upon the movie *the Room*, however, and *Birdemic*.)        

The movie gives us about thirty minutes of characterization, most of it of Liam Neeson's character, but with a lesser smattering of his daughter and his ex-wife's. His ex-wife might at first seem like a cold-hearted frost-queen, and his daughter a flighty and irrelevant child, but that's just the window-dressing, the start of characters that have more depth. The success of the movie, in my opinion, is evidence (though not proof positive) that there was more to them than might be supposed by someone half-remembering the movie based upon the one time he watched it 12 years ago.        

His wife spent years waiting for a call telling her that her husband and daughter's father had died. He never, it seems, said ""no"" to an assignment, and spent long months away, rather than spending time with his child. His wife eventually become fed up with him not being there, and always being worried, and divorced him for a wealthy, stable family man.          

His daughter? She doesn't need that much depth. She's a silly 17-year-old, just like we all were at one time. She gets overly excited, too-easily upset, is a bit mischievous but, just like many of us, is good at heart. She's also a bit of a fighter (smashed the mirror with one guy's head, as is strongly indicated later) and was surprisingly calm under pressure, all things considered, when she followed instructions that ultimately led to her rescue.         

Then there's Brad, Liam Neeson's character. He gives up his job and money to get closer to his daughter after he realizes the folly of putting career before family. He struggles, he sacrifices, and he spends nights thinking about time he lost and the time he hopes to regain. He also, naturally, has a particular set of skills.         

Sure, it may not be quite as hefty as I'm describing it here, but it's there, and I think that the movie gives us enough time to get a sense for all of this.        

I think the _real_ meat of the movie is the fact that virtually every sequence, particularly from the moment the daughter picks up the phone while in her friends' cousin's home to talk to her father and onward, is brilliantly executed.        
A movie is made up of scenes that connect to build the overall narrative, particularly movies that aren't particularly artsy or trying to do something experimental.        

So we get the kidnapping scene. This sets up the rest of the movie with a beautifully directed and acted sequence of intense, suspenseful _dread._ We hope and hope, even knowing the title of the movie, but when Brian says, ""This is important,"" pauses for a beat in which even *he* seems to hope that there is some other possible outcome, but then delivers the fateful line, ""they're going to take you,"" there's a kind of horrifying inevitability to it. It's not pretty, dressed up or theatrical. It's utilitarian, pragmatic. A statement of fact. And we are resigned to its truth.         

Then the scene directly following in which Brad's friend has determined who the man who took her is. It's a somber scene, quiet. The whole house seems like a silent monster, ready to swallow them up as Brad puts the phone on speaker and his friend explains the situation. Eleanor becomes increasingly upset, and finally bursts into tears when she hears the exact reason her daughter was taken, and the overwhelming likelihood that she will never be seen again.        

No point in going over every scene, but some highlights are the sequence where he talks to Marco and the other thugs in their own joint that he managed to enter by using a fake ID. He casts about confidently and cleverly for clues, to determine if he's at the right place and found the right people.       
The sequence in Jean-Claude's house where we see that Liam cares about nothing more than his daughter, to the point that he's willing to shoot an old friend's wife in the arm to prove his point.         
The torture scene with some excellent acting from both individuals. It's dark, gloomy and resoundingly quiet. When the bulb is flickering and the man being tortured has his head thrown back and the veins in his neck are bulging with stress, we're shown the placid expression on Brad's face. He doesn't care about this individual. He cares about precisely one thing. 

I guess if one's definition of a ""good"" movie requires it to be incomprehensibly artful, or extraordinarily smart, and pose some Grand Truth to mull over while swishing wine (all fine things) then this is not a good movie by that definition.          

If, however, you yourself are a writer, a comic book maker, a song-writer, a *storyteller*, then I think you may agree that the ability to tell a story with human characters, with excellent pacing, with enjoyable cinematography, solid action choreography, fantastic sound effects (the gun shots in this movie are shockingly present) and entertaining sequences from beginning to end is a skill in itself, to be appreciated as much as a great plot twist (*Sixth Sense*) or an ambiguous ending (*Inception*) or breakthrough special effects (*Jurassic Park*).        

If you don't like the movie, there are undoubtedly plenty of valid reasons that might be, but I don't believe ""It's an action movie with a plot we have seen before"" is a good reason to consider this a bad movie.          

So that's my defense of Taken. It's not a fire-and-forget blockbuster. It's a movie that is consistently good in just about every category throughout its entire run-time.",movies,1579406207,Selrisitai,8,1,True,2020-01-18

"With the newest one being released, what‚Äôs your favourite version of Little Women?","Ever since the newest movie came out, my secret obsession has been coming back again. Naturally, one comes to the point where they ask *which one is the best*. I love them all, and it‚Äôs hard for me to decide!

1933: The only really good part for me here is Katharine Hepburn. She‚Äôs phenomenal here, she perfectly encapsulates Jo‚Äôs tragic side. She‚Äôs tough but playful. She perfectly shows how desperate Jo is not to have her wings clipped, not to grow up. It seems that the filmmakers were so keen on developing her that they forget about the other women in *Little Women*. They‚Äôre pretty one note. Joan Bennett is far too old to play Amy, I mean she was even pregnant for most of production. The others are incredible forgettable. Laurie, included. He‚Äôs played off as a sidekick to Jo here, and he gets irrationally angry and mean to her when she rejects him. Also, professor Behr here is pretty... questionable.

1949: People hate this one and I never understood why. I feel as though June Allyson was picked on far too much (probably because she followed Hepburn not-so-soon after). Although, while I do like her portrayal as a hard-mean spirited Jo, I can agree that she gets a bit *too* headstrong at times. The rest of the cast is incredible. I love Elizabeth Taylor as Amy, I find her quite funny. Janet Leigh, although not given much to do, is quite effective for what she‚Äôs given. The star for me though is Margaret O‚ÄôBrien. I really like the switch between ages of Amy and Beth, it makes her death so much more tragic. Laurie is also improved, he actually has a character! Additionally, making Behr younger and more charismatic makes it more obvious why Jo picked him.

1994: The first one I ever saw, and the one I fell in love with. This version gives me my favourite score: Thomas Newman‚Äôs music is brilliant. I got a copy for my birthday last year. It‚Äôs just as good as the movie itself! Wyonna Ryder‚Äôs great. She‚Äôs sweet, caring and feisty (especially when she gets mad at Amy). For the first time the movie shows her creative side, we see Jo actually write her plays! Kirsten Dunst is a great Amy too (she‚Äôs worth having even if they had to cast an older Amy as well). This movie also gives us Claire Danes as Beth, and her performance makes me cry. EVERY. TIME. Also, this movie has Christian Bale as my favourite Laurie of the bunch, so there‚Äôs that. Hate his goatee though. The biggest problem though I have with the movie is that I can‚Äôt buy Laurie and Amy together. She had grown out of her childish phase where she fantasized over him, so I do not really understand. The chemistry isn‚Äôt there either when she‚Äôs an adult. Other than that, this version might be my favourite.

2019: Greta Gerwig is the better director in my opinion. The cinematography is also superior. I love how they set up the story, showing the parallels within the narrative. The cast (again) is awesome. My biggest complaint is how they portray Behr. I understand the point they‚Äôre trying to make about the author, but I simply don‚Äôt care. I love how, in the ‚Äò94 version, they made him an intellectual match for Jo. They had more in common, and despite the age difference, I liked how it played out. This movie also didn‚Äôt get to me emotionally like the ‚Äò94 one. I came close to crying, but at the same time the other one had me bawling.

I know that there‚Äôs one set in modern day (2018), and a TV show with Maya Hawke, but I haven‚Äôt seen them so I cannot compare.

Ratatouille is one of Disney (and Pixar's) greatest achievements.,"I came across it whilst browsing D+ and, since I hadn't watched it in almost a decade. decided to check it out to see if it was as good as I remembered it.

There are very few movies that I would say are ""perfect"" but this might be one of them. The story, the animation, the voice-acting, the music, everything filled me with inexpressible joy. I even admit to have been thoroughly moved by the time the credits rolled.

A movie is supposed to be something more than a bunch of pictures shown in quick succession and this one managed to surpass even my extremely positive memory of it. By turns comic, tragic, macabre, and sentimental, this is a towering achievement by Brad Bird and his team and an essential part of the Pixar library.

Trying to identify tropes for my favorite niche horror/thriller genre.,"I recently went on my first multi-hour TV Tropes binge. What a ride. It inspired me to come here and ask for help finding the names of some of the tropes present in my favorite niche genre, in the hopes of identifying more movies in that genre that I've never heard of.

I like to call this genre ""**weird group survival**"". These are generally B-movie horror/thriller films, though not always. The loose template is **a group of people suddenly finding themselves in a struggle for survival, often without understanding how they got there, and almost always devolving into a last man standing situation against each other**, even if the initial/ostensible threat is something outside the group. 

Here's the list of movies that I've got so far:

* Circle
* The Human Race
* Battle Royale
* Devil
* Exam
* Cube
* Elevator
* Arena (surely Samuel L. Jackson's most underrated film)
* The Belko Experiment
* The Call Up
* That one Saw movie where it was about group survival
* Open Grave
* 10 Cloverfield Lane
* The Maze Runner
* The Hunger Games (the first one)
* Gamer
* Death Race

Couldn't Understand Mystic River's ending,I just finished watching Mystic River on Netflix. The movie was really good for the most part but I failed to understand the ending. Jimmy kills Dave and even after realising that he wasn't the culprit hardly feels any remorse. Also I really disliked the parade scene in the end where Jimmy's wife consoles him and tries making him feel less regretful about Dave's death and gives this weird and unnecessary motivational speech about how Jimmy must do everything to protect their daughters and become the king of the area. Jimmy seems to have bought this justification for his crime given by his wife and then he proceeds to make out with her??! It makes no sense at all and this scene feels so unnatural and disconnected from the whole plot of the movie. Also during the parade why doesn't anyone seem to care about Celeste who has just lost her husband and who was killed for the wrong reasons. Also since Sean knows that Jimmy is the murderer why doesn't he arrest him and how is he all okay with his innocent friend being dead??,movies,1579411231,dazzlingdonkey470,9,1,True,2020-01-19

Cach√© (2005) is amazing and goes beyond the mystery aspect,"Every time I watch a film by Michael Haneke I fall more in love with him and his movies, he's one of the greatest filmmakers of our time; simply a genius, I wish I could crawl inside his brain and see the way he¬†thinks.

There a three things Haneke plays with on all of his movies, and they are perfectly used in Cach√©: the idea of disruption, playing and somehow criticizing the audience, and the ability he has to create a lot of feeling from watching his movies. This movie starts as a thriller, with the mystery of the notes and the tapes, but it's something that quickly fades to the background as the characters, accompanied by amazing performances, are surrounded by fears, with an intrusion of the past and the hidden things in their lives. Ultimately, the notes and the tapes are sort of surreal, as they may be a product and a representation of guilt and the subconscious of Georges catching up to him.¬†

There's some great camera work and editing behind this, as we sometimes can't know if we are watching a recording or a ""real"" scene, with the line between the two sometimes blurring (it reminded me a lot of Perfect Blue). With this, Haneke is making us see that we are also observing these people, we are also intruders in their lives and are watching something alien to us. We shouldn't be there, and there's a feeling of guilt that plays with the audience. The way the movie is made goes in line with all of this, with great camera work and some shots that make us uneasy and sometimes is even claustrophobic.¬†

Regarding the themes of the film, I saw it as a commentary on social class and status, with something invading and interrupting the life of this high-class people. They are haunted by the past, guarding secrets and willing to do anything so their name isn't stained. Xenophobia is also really present, with the main character excluding someone different, with the guilt coming back to¬†him.

Ultimately, it's a great film about guilt, class, racism and more. Haneke keeps on delivering masterpieces.",movies,1579413321,Hobbit-guy,2,1,True,2020-01-19

Trying to remeber a scary movie based on one scene i saw as a kid thats haunted me ever since.,"This is based on curiosity and maybe it will help me get over it.

Its an old movie, 90's I think. **The scene:** guy and girl are making out in a jeep, i think, and she pulls away and wants to go inside a house or basement to keep making out. She gets a headstart, he goes inside to find her laying across a model town, part of a train set i think. She is all seductive and motions for him to come over. As he walks forward he steps into some slime, and i think its dissolving him or he's sinking in it. He asks for her help but she just smiles and laughs as he eventually disappears  into it.",movies,1579416277,gifmaker777,11,1,True,2020-01-19
Will Smith can STILL do great.,"I just came from Bad Boys For Life and I was expecting to see bayhem like no tomorrow but left pretty moved and a Stallone-in-Creed-esque performance. And I can't believe this came from a Bad Boys movie. Playing an over-the-hill action hero the way he played it was surprisingly moving. I didn't really see the caricature and unstoppable hero I've been used to seeing him post-Independence Day. 

This will get probably downvoted to oblivion because I've seen this sub isn't a big fan of him but I hope his next choice of films pull out more raw performances opposed to the same shit we've been used to seeing.

Best Animated Film 2019,"Every year when award season shows up, I bemoan that I haven't seen more of the films critics and associations deemed that year's best, and this year is no exception. I still haven't seen Parasite, Little Women, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, 1914, Knives Out, and countless other films that have been celebrated and I really want to watch, but haven't gotten around to yet. Only so much time and money to go around, you know?

However, this year the streaming services have made it a bit easier to play catch-up, as at least some of the award-winning films are included on these services. And as it happens, when looking at the Academy Award nominees for Best Picture, all but one of the films selected are already on either Netflix or Hulu. That final film, Toy Story 4, is one I just happen to have purchased, and many of you will have likely seen it, so I recommend you take a moment and watch through all of the following films if you can, since you likely already have the services you need to watch them for no added cost.

As such, I feel like I can actually say for the first time in ages who I feel should win in this category, since i have now watched through all of these films (with my girl, as well). We both pretty much agreed in how we'd rank them as well, so whatever stock you put in these recommendations, double it.

Anyway, here are my thoughts on this year's Academy Award nominees for best animated picture, in order from least-liked to most:

**5. I Lost My Body** (Netflix) - First off, a warning: don't watch this movie with the kiddies. It's pretty violent in places, and there are probably parts they'll find scary. This movie tells the story of a young man's life told from the perspective of his right hand... interspersed with the story of that hand after it is severed from said young man, and on a perilous journey. I absolutely loved the artistry in this film - it has an amazing, unique artistic vision, and an astounding attention to detail. The characters are three-dimensional people too, and don't just do the typical story beats expected of them. Having said that, I was really disappointed with this film's ending. I wanted more. I wanted something that explained the whole ""hand"" thing, I wanted a better sense of closure for the film's central romantic-ish plot. I felt like this film ended just a few minutes before it should, and something was missing at the end to give it the deeper meaning it was aiming for. As a result, to me, it felt like it was a great vision that was ultimately lacking.

**4. Missing Link** (Hulu) - Laika is clearly the master of their craft, and every time I think they can't possibly top themselves, they find a way. On a technical level, this stop-motion film is an absolute masterpiece, with stunning levels of detail in the world and animations that make it easy to forget that this thing was pieced together frame-by-frame. This movie is a wonder to behold... but in terms of its actual plot, this was a cartoon, with cartoonish characters, a cartoonish plot, and an ending you could see coming from a mile away. It wasn't bad, by any stretch, but I felt that it's a far cry even from Laika's earlier works like Coraline and Kubo and the Two Strings.

**2/3 Tie. How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World** (Hulu) and **Toy Story 4** - I feel like it must be difficult to end a series, with many movies failing to deliver a truly satisfying end to a saga. Hell, even The Godfather couldn't manage to conclude in a satisfactory way. Yet both How to Train Your Dragon and Toy Story found a way to do so that honored their respective long-running series and gave fans an excellent conclusion. How to Train Your Dragon did so with an ending that felt like it built on everything that came before it, while also calling back to important moments from the series' past. And Toy Story 4 managed to somehow give a proper ending to a series that already had a proper ending, since the third film was a pretty good stopping point for the trilogy... yet the fourth film works as a good end to the saga of the series' main character. Both had their flaws - How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World felt like it repeated a lot of plot points from the second film and had a lot of unnecessary sub-plots, while Toy Story 4 seemed to treat a lot of its ensemble cast of characters as, well, accessories. However, they're still both superb ways to end a saga.

**1. Klaus** (Netflix) - I hate Christmas movies. Despise them. I feel that they use sentimentality in place of story, plot and character. So watching Klaus was like a breath of fresh air, since this movie makes its characters the focal point of the movie, and does the hard work of justifying its sentimentality. While this film used its animation to paint a cartoonish exaggeration of a town under siege by feud, its plot is otherwise fairly grounded, with the only ""magic"" here quite possibly only in its characters' heads. However, it does a great job of building a plausible origin to the Santa Claus legend, and even does a great job of making us care about its characters, even after establishing pretty much all of them as big assholes. This film was one of my biggest delightful surprises this year, and if you get one thing out of reading this article, it's that I sincerely hope that you take a moment to watch this film, even though we're well out of the holiday season now. I think you'll find it to be worth your time.

I hope you find this helpful, and i hope you enjoy yourselves some good movies! :-)",movies,1579418354,CaspianX2,4,1,True,2020-01-19

I don't like Rocky,"So I finally watched Rocky, because it's Rocky, and was not impressed. The main error for me was Adrian. She is obviously not into Rocky, but then her brother forces her to hangout with Rocky. and then he sexually assaults her and then after the fight she loves him? What!??? Adrian is the weakest female characters I have ever seen in a movie. Another problem comes with Sylvesters performance, I understand it's his first time in cinema but why does he go on tangents where he says the same sentence like five times ""you put my bag on skid row"" it gets annoying quick. A more minor flaw that I'd still like to discuss is the camera work, it's all outside the ring and doesn't let the viewer have as much emotion in the fight. where as Raging Bull (which only came out 3 years later) does a much better job with camera work and keeps the camera in the boxing ring.

Looking for a movie I watched a long time ago,"So I remember watching this movie back in 2006 or earlier. 

It was a romantic movie, the main characters are a man and a woman. The woman's name was Lily. and she was blond.

It was so long ago and I don't remember much detail.

So basically, the man was kind of lonely and one time he called customer service for something he needs help with I guess, and the woman named Lily picked up. They talked and he liked her. And later he called again even tho he didn't need to call there is nothing he needs help with. And he called again and again, always asking for Lily. Eventually Lily either quit the job or, just refused to answer his phone.And I guess he found her work place, and they dated I guess. Don't remember much of the story.

But, I do remember one thing very clearly, the ending.

Eventually she came around they are together, the final scene is Lily watering his apartment's balcony's flowers in the sunset. The light was bright orange, very beautiful. and she was blond with kind of a short hair. Kind of look like Marguerite MacIntyre.

Did anyone notice the similarity between the cultures featured in The Farewell and Midsommar? (major spoilers for both),"Couldn't find anyone mention The Farewell in the [discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/c7y18a/official_discussion_midsommar_spoilers/?sort=top)

Obviously one is more directly rooted in reality, but the actions of the family taking in the pain of someone passing on felt familiar while watching Midsommar. In The Farewell it was about the family lying to Nai Nai to take in the pain of her going through illness.

In Midsommar there are the scenes of the 72 year olds yeeting off the cliff before they have the chance to die old, but actually the scenes later are more symmetric to The Farewell with the ladies imitating Dani's cries and the whole commune screaming in pain as the ones in the temple burn.

It's interesting to mention because throughout Midsommar, it obviously feels like a batshit crazy religion they're peddling, but some aspects can be seen as plausible and understandable with the similarities to real traditions, like the Chinese family in The Farewell. Also supposedly there are some articles that have said that elders jumping off cliffs could have been a possibility in old pagan religions.",movies,1579428267,ninjyte,2,1,True,2020-01-19

My Parasite(2019) review,"A dumb bunch of Marxist propaganda¬†

Parasite, directed by Joon-Ho Bong, director of the excellent character study 'Memories of Murder' received an about 8 minutes long standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival. It also seems to be widely known now as a 'masterpiece', a term that flows easily these days. However, the truth is that it is simply a mediocrity, and the only reason this acclaim is received seems to be for the fact that it appeals to Marxist nut jobs because it deems poor people to be superior to rich people.

Now, Bong doesn't depict our four protagonists as angels. On the contrary, they are scheming, immoral, disgusting, conniving, backstabbing low lifes, but the salient issue here is the fact that, especially in the later phases of the film, Bong wants the audience to feel pity for these four morons. Of course, our poor 'heroes' manage to scheme into a rich household in an extremely absurd &amp; easy matter, made even easier by the gullible nature of the rich. Herein lies another problem. Standard human behavior is altered in order to fit Bong's sociological narrative, meaning that the rich man &amp; woman are indeed too stupid to figure out anything, whereas a bunch of lazy criminal nut jobs who can't even fold a pizza box properly are genius in their scheming. It makes no logical sense, and suspension of disbelief can be a good thing, but not when it is made for a ham fisted social message. That's simply a lack of creativity in writing.

There's also of course the far fetched plot points.. such as the secret door behind the bookcase. That nobody in the house has figured that out in four years is really something that stretches beyond suspension of disbelief, and the fact that someone was down there all the time is even dumber, not to mention the revelation near the end when the dad takes the guys's place. They're not exactly plot holes, but they are illogicalities that are another result of the very poor screenplay.

In the technical aspects, Parasite doesn't disappoint as much, as the photography is adequate, coupled with an excellent score &amp; generally good cinematography. Thus, it is alright to look at, but it is impossible to overlook the glaring holes in the substantial aspects. The acting is good for the most part, especially by the rich wife, who was however a completely idiotic and unbelievable hysterical character, further decreasing the subtleties between the depiction of the classes.

In the end, Parasite was created as a depiction of class struggle, and while it does show the poor people as wicked creatures, Bong nonetheless deems it necessary with his narrative that we as an audience should care for them, even though they deserve every single evil they can get. We, as the audience, are supposed to judge based on class distinction which people are good and which people are bad, as opposed to something like character development, which generally is the more important thing.",movies,1579431888,outer234,0,1,True,2020-01-19

"Certain elements of film (cinematography, aesthetics, dialogue etc.) are usually designed with a set purpose in mind. Can you think of film elements that backfired (spectacularly) and did the opposite of their intended purpose?","So, for example, take Anastasia‚Äôs Dimitri. Fox Animation modelled him to be shorter and scrawnier than the average fairy tale male protagonist, almost all of which, were princes. He was intentionally made imperfect and unappealing as he was a conman in the movie.

Movie Pics Quiz,"Hi all - I knock up picture movie quizzes for a FB group and thought some of you here might enjoy it.  


44 scenes from movie cut down to hopefully range from easy to wtf. Not sure if you want to post in the thread (which maybe spoils it for others who want a go) or message me your answers. Because I'm a complete nerd I've already got an Excel sheet to keep track of who got what ones right and keep track of scores for the group so can easily add people here to that. Up to you. No idea what works best.

I was excited to see a fennec fox in Zootopia. I love fennec foxes, they're adorable creatures, and they're barely in any movie I can think of so I was happy to see a big mainstream movie acknowledge their existence.

And then he was barely in the movie. Like, I knew he wasn't one of the main characters, so I didn't expect him to be in a huge amount of the movie but I expected more than 3 lines from him.

Finally saw Hellboy (2019) and the special effects makeup is worse than I thought. How did this happen?,"Maybe I am a little biased because I think the original Hellboy films are awesome but this was just bad design. I‚Äôm a huge fan of special effects makeup and I was honestly shocked by how awful the Hellboy makeup looks. 

The red color looks desaturated. The way that the brow is sculpted hides the actors eyes in way that limits his ability to emote. The mouth looks so thick and you can barely see any teeth. It makes it seem like he‚Äôs old and missing teeth. The texture of the makeup seems off too. Honestly, it looks like good comic-con makeup that‚Äôs not really meant to be on screen. 

I think Ron Pearlman had the perfect base for the character bone structure wise. I also feel like that makeup was executed in a flawless manner. Does anybody know who‚Äôs responsible for the new Hellboy makeup?",movies,1579446596,helvetica_unicorn,28,1,True,2020-01-19
Can anyone name some movies containing GOOD priests?,"Hey r/movies. I've been watching a bunch of movies and shows with a friend of mine, and I noticed a weird pattern; Every time a priest showed up on screen, he immediately assumed they were a bad guy and proceeded to hate on them. I asked him about it, and he straight up said that he automatically hates priests in movies because they are always bad guys. Admittedly he does mostly watch big dumb action movies, where it's easy and cheesy to juxtapose a violent character with symbolism of religious piety. But it didn't stop at action movies, everytime we saw a priest on screen they were judgemental, or an alcoholic, or a power-mongering political strategist, or they were concealing some dark sinful habits. It was uncanny.

So, I'm looking to challenge my friend's little unconscious bias. I want to see some more positive representation of priests in film.  Off the top of my head I can only think of a few; The exorcist, Exorcism of emily rose (exorcism movies are acutally pretty good for this), the Book of Eli, Angels with dirty faces, Friar Tuck in  Robin Hood, The catholic father from Daredevil, Nacho Libre weirdly. There must be swaths of movies I'm just not thinking of. 

Help me find some movie-priests that are just good folks. Bonus points if they're a main character, but I'll take some supporting cast action too.",movies,1579446668,TheMightyBill,218,1,True,2020-01-19

A Marriage Story: Gender Bias?,"Minor spoilers ahead. 

I just finished _A Marriage Story_ and while it was pretty good, I realized through most of the divorce I thought the father was getting unfair treatment. He was surprised by the divorce process after they agreed not to use lawyers, the mother filed out of state requiring him to frequently fly down, and the mother didn't provide as much pushback as I would have expected to her very aggressive lawyer, which in my mind made her a jerk. At the end of the movie I felt the mother as a whole was of weaker character than the father, who of course also had faults. 

Having said that I admit that as a man I could be adding some serious gender bias. I remember as a kid criticizing my mom for always taking a woman friend's side in a divorce regardless of the situation like ""oh, sure she was physically abusive, but that's not as bad as the emotional abuse she was receiving.""

"Bone Tomahawk, while great, finished weakly... [Spoilers]","...but here's how I would fix it using only the established elements of the film.

The current ending:

&gt;Arthur and his wife walk away from the carnage, happy to be alive. Far behind them, the Sheriff‚Äôs final gunshots are heard.

**ARTHUR‚ÄôS LETTER TO HIS WIFE**

Arthur and his wife are first seen holding a letter in bed. She asks him to read it to her but he doesn‚Äôt get the chance before she‚Äôs kidnapped. Before following her, Arthur makes a point to get the letter, hold it up, say aloud ‚Äúyou‚Äôll hear it soon, baby,‚Äù and put it in his pocket. And then‚Ä¶ it never comes up again. We as the audience can *assume* he reads it to her after the events of the movie but that‚Äôs not fulfilling. Picture this instead:

&gt;Arthur and his wife walk away from the carnage, happy to be alive. Far behind them, the Sheriff‚Äôs final gunshots are heard. Arthur, limping, reaches down to his pocket and we see what he‚Äôs pulled out: a small folded letter. He looks to his wife.

**THE DYNAMITE**

A huge cloud of dirt and smoke rises from what used to be the monsters‚Äô lair. Arthur, limping, doesn't turn around, doesn't break his stride, but instead reaches down to his pocket and we see what he‚Äôs pulled out: a small folded letter. He looks to his wife.

1917 is overrated,"8.6 on IMDb, critical darling, and at this point, basically a lock to win Best Picture at the Oscars. The hype train for this movie would have you believe this is the greatest movie of the last decade.

I mean it is definitely a good movie, especially the production design and cinematography. However it does not live up to all this hype and I don't see this movie standing the test of time. 

Outside of the amazing visuals and production value, 1917 is painfully generic.  The main characters have about as much character development as some of the extras and disposable characters in better war movies. They are pretty much your standard, run-in-the-mill average joe WWI soldier characters. 

1917 is also too predictable. Within the first 10 minutes of the movie you know exactly where the story is headed, and how it will end, you know exactly which one of the 2 main characters is going to die. You basically know the entire gist of the movie right off the bat. The story doesn't unfold properly. You are just given exposition at the very beginning of the movie, and within 5 minutes after you are easily able to infer everything about the story. 

Shit, even the title of the movie - ""1917"" - is about as a generic and uncreative as it gets.",movies,1579455737,SpaghettiDelicious,83,1,True,2020-01-19

"I marathon'ed the Dark Knight Trilogy, circlejerk &amp; review inside","I had seen Begins &amp; Dark Knight before, but I had never seen Rises. Because it had been a while since I saw the first two I thought it would be a good idea to do them all. And it paid off.

First of all, we all love or at least like Chistopher Nolan (and his brother). He makes blockbuster movies that try to be a bit smarter than the usual stuff. 

And that's the main thing I found impressive; in the trilogy he balances seriousness so well with the usual comic book hero that it makes the movies a lot more enjoyable than your average superhero flick. 

The stories of each movie alone are already fine, but it's nice that the whole also feels very coherent. 

Batman Begins is a little sloppy when it comes to the action stuff, though. It's clear that Nolan didn't have a lot of experience shooting fight scenes. That cam-shake in the first fight sequence in prison... That was actually terrible. 

I think I like each movie about equally. It's a solid trilogy. I don't think they are as great as for example IMDb makes it look like they are, but they are very fine comic book movies with a little more bite than I'm used to.",movies,1579455896,PindasausenTaart,7,1,True,2020-01-19

Need help identifying some some obscure films,"Hello r/movies, and thanks for your time.

I'm trying to identify a few films, one of which I barely remember from my childhood and the other is part of a modern flick. 

1) I tried IMDB and Wikipedia and Google, but was unable to find any information on the black-and-white film Bill Murray watches in Broken Flowers. I don't know if this is akin to the fake gangster movie from Home Alone or just a very obscure classic. 

2) When I was a little kid, I saw some film on TV about a group of peasants trying to stop a demon from destroying their village. All I recall is that there's a scene early on when they're going into a mountain/cave at night, and we get a shot of the moon with a winged demon flying across it; that they somehow end up in a modern-day city; there's a scene where one character is in a TV store and is overwhelmed by the walls of screens (there may be another scene like this involving a subway, I don't quite recall). I want to say that this film was from the 1970s or '80s, but it's possible it was very early '90s.

Is it a bad acting or bad guidance?,"First, if this is not the right sub, which one is?

To the question.
 I'm watching this tv show and I have some negative opinion about acting and id like to discuss it with someone.
If I say this show or that actor sucks, ill get negatives but also very few if any responses (answer's) I'm looking for so I'm a bit hesitant to say which show I have in mind and probably will not. But maybe the name is not required even.

Question is how to know if an actor was bad or had bad guidelines or if his role was to be that much out of place on purpose.
This particular role is ment to be in a way, out of circle because it's a new guy in well formed community. But it feels like he's a bad actor too. Like actor took already established model's that had success in other tv shows of same roles he's playing now. Anyway.. this question pop's out from time to time and I've never asked it untill now.

Replace 1 Movie from each Oscar Category,"If you could replace 1 movie in a given Oscar category with another, what movie would you replace and why? Here's my list:

**Production Design**: Replace **The Irishman** with **High Life.** 'The Irishman' production team did a great job capturing an era, but I really dug the Solaris-esque design of the spaceship in 'High Life'. 

**Cinematography:** Replace **The Irishman** with **Parasite (Hong Kang-pyu)**. There's a lot to like in 'Parasite' that its easy to overlook the cinematography, but 'Parasite' is probably my favorite looking film of the year, especially in the way it uses shadow. 

**Film Editing:** Replace **Joker** with **Little Women**. Honestly didn't think much about the editing in 'Joker', but so much of what makes 'Little Women' great is the way the film remixes the source material in a way that feels organic and makes thematic sense.

**Adapted Screenplay:** Replace **The Two Popes** with **Transit**. 'Transit' makes one big change from the source material, and that change makes the film resonate so much more. 

**Original Screenplay**: Replace **Once Upon a Time in Hollywood** with **Her Smell**. I liked 'OUATIH', but I had some issues with the pacing and how some of the characters are utilized. Across just a few long scenes, the screenplay for 'Her Smell' manages to capture what dealing with an addict would be like in horrifying detail, and the arc that the film takes is one of the most satisfying I've seen all year.

**Supporting Actor:** Replace **Anthony Hopkins** with **Hong Sang-So** for 'Parasite'. I liked Hopkins' performance as Ratzinger, and was very tempted to replace him with Dafoe for 'The Lighthouse', but Hong Sang-So's understated performance as a man trying to keep it together until he can't anymore is definitely Oscar-worthy.

**Lead Actress:** Replace **Saoirse Ronan** with **Elizabeth Moss** for 'Her Smell'. This one's tricky because I haven't seen 'Bombshell', 'Judy', or 'Harriet', but I'm taking out Saoirse because while I liked her performance, it didn't stand out to me as the best performance even within 'Little Women' (Florence Pugh I think does the best work in the film). Elizabeth Moss basically carries 'Her Smell'. It's a gutsy performance (on par IMO with Joaquin Phoenix's, without the physical transformation) that was unlike any I've seen this year.

**Lead Actor:** Replace **Jonathon Pryce** with **Robert Pattinson** for 'The Lighthouse'. Adam Sandler in 'Uncut Gems' is a strong contender as well, but ultimately I admired the smoldering resentment, guilt, and rage that Pattinson brings to 'The Lighthouse' a little more than Sandler's performance. 

**Best Foreign Language Film:** Replace **Les Miserables** with **Transit**. NGL of the Foreign Language nominees I've only seen 'Parasite', but Transit was one of my favorite movies of the year and it's mostly in French, so it seems like a fair swap.

**Best Director:** Replace **Todd Philips** with **Greta Gerwig**. I liked Todd Philips' direction in 'Joker', but it didn't really stand out to me compared to a lot of the other films that came out this year. Robert Eggers (The Lighthouse), Claire Denis (High Life), The Safdie Brothers (Uncut Gems) are all worthy nominees, but I admire Gerwig's reinventing of a story that's been told many times before but without the panache of her version. I went into her film not knowing (or caring) much about 'Little Women', I left absolutely awestruck. 

**Best Picture:** Replace **Joker** with **The Lighthouse**. Both are boundary-pushing films in their own right, but 'The Lighthouse' is crazier, funnier, and just better than 'Joker'.",movies,1579464564,Mr_Milieu,19,1,True,2020-01-19

2. Angel of Mine on Netflix, brilliant slow paced and very creepy Psychological thriller starring Noomi Rapace. the ending should of went in a diffrent direction but Im just fussy for bleaker endings.

Was I the only one who felt underwhelmed by 1917?,"This will contain spoilers:

My biggest issue with the film is that there was absolutely no connection to the characters. I know the biggest counter argument is that it‚Äôs a film that you experience (the whole film filmed like it was in one take). I understand that however in my opinion it doesn‚Äôt work for 1917. Whereas it does work for Dunkirk in my opinion. Dunkirk was a film that was about the event and the experience too but showcased it much better as you get to see the entire scope of the battle. In 1917 you follow 2 soldiers (until 1 dies fairly early) and you see things from their perspective. You never see the full scope of the battle to get immersed in and you never have enough connection to the characters to care when they are in danger or die. I literally cannot remember the names of the 2 main soldier characters. When one of the main characters died I personally didn‚Äôt really care that much even though it was fairly unpredictable. 

This is not to say it‚Äôs a bad film, it it technically a fantastic film and the acting overall is solid. I‚Äôd give it a 7/10 but in my opinion does not deserve all these beat picture nominations and wins.",movies,1579465310,Fncrs,5,1,True,2020-01-19
"I found Ad Astra to be extremely relatable, perhaps TOO relatable...","I've seen criticisms from some people that Pitt's character wasn't relatable. 

Pitt's opening monologue in the film describes EXACTLY what I had felt my whole life (""I see myself from the outside"" and ""it's a performance""). I felt like this 24/7. I later learned that this was depersonsalition disorder, which is a form of dissociation. 
 
Like Pitt's character, I was an emotionally repressed and detached guy and this was largely due to my own issues with my dad. A lot of Roy's behaviour traits in the film and world view, i saw in myself (lack of stress in high pressure situations, dislike of people, etc).

So when Pitt's character breaks down once confronting his traumas and ultimately gains a new optimistic outlook on life after confronting his dad, I knew instantly what he felt like. I went through the same life beats; 1) emotionally repressed and disassociated 24/7, 2) emotional breakdown after confronting past trauma and 3) optimistic outlook after finally resolving conflict 

I think for me, this film hit way too close to home. During certain scenes of the film, the dialogue felt like thoughts in my own head... 

I've read many criticisms as to Pitt's character being unrelatable because of his lack of emotion. In your view, is this a criticism of the character archetype itself (emotionally repressed) or the film's storytelling structure?",movies,1579465531,Throwaaygf7yhk,9,1,True,2020-01-19

#Joker and the Problems of Narrative Framing

**1. What Do You Want?**

So *Joker* got nominated for 11 Oscars. All this means is that we are now talking about whether the film is ‚Äúgood, actually‚Äù or ‚Äúbad, actually.‚Äù Hurray for the discourse!

But if you‚Äôve read me enough, you know I don‚Äôt really like the words good and bad. I get why they show up a lot in criticism. Every day movie-goers are often trying to justify how one should spend 20 bucks at a theater, so the essential question becomes ‚Äúis it worth it?‚Äù But it‚Äôs really hard to answer that question because the notion of ‚Äúgood quality‚Äù can go in so many different directions. Especially with a film like Joker. It‚Äôs like, what, you want me to talk about the lighting? It‚Äôs pretty darn great. Do you want to know if Joaquin Phoenix is an incredible talented actor who breathes life into his performance? Yeah, he totally does. But there‚Äôs always going to be a relativism with these kinds of appraisals. Just as there are going to be snooty people who believe dramas are inherently ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than comedies. But I believe it was Roger Ebert who often cited the more apt question‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúIs the movie doing what it‚Äôs trying to do?‚Äù

Is it succeeding on it‚Äôs own merits? And when you look at things in terms of execution alone, you can happily make the argument that *Mad Max: Fury Road* is as good as *Duck Soup* is as good *The Godfather* is as good as *Daises* is as, yada yada yada. A lot of people seem caught up in this particular dialogue when it comes to the critical success of Joker, with it being dark ‚Äúcomic book film‚Äù and all, but these questions are largely distractions from what‚Äôs really going on. Sometimes getting to the heart of a film even goes beyond appraisals of relativism. Sometimes, it is actually about getting into the complicated question of how we value the ‚Äúwhat it‚Äôs trying to do,‚Äù for it that there that we often find the most truthful version of the thematic crux. It directly taps into the old Cormac McCarthy-ism, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt know anyone until you know what they want.‚Äù So perhaps, I can ask a much better question.

‚ÄúWhat does *Joker* want?‚Äù

On the surface. It presents a lot of ideas of what it wants to be about, from mental health, to class, to abuse. You could throw a dart at any scene in the movie and probably hit a meaningful subject. But when it comes to the way those ideas stack up into a meaningful depiction? 

Well, that‚Äôs where we get into the problems of framing.

**2. ‚Äú‚Ä¶ From A Certain Point of View‚Äù**

When we talk about unreliable narrative and viewer distrust, we often think about it in literal terms. Something like Kurosawa‚Äôs masterpiece *Rashomon*, where he has characters presenting competing narratives in hopes of finding the truth. By watching this unfold, the audience can observe a great truth about humanity: that people can hide, warp, and belie narratives, often to their own selfish or placating purposes. I feel like many people understand this, but I understand both the power and terror of this habit implicitly, for I‚Äôve both borne and bared it. We don‚Äôt usually like to call it lying, but that‚Äôs what it is. And the simple reality is that humans really have to learn to see themselves soberly, for that is where we become our healthiest selves. But often, in our lifelong journeys, we learn this the hard way.

In essence, the same is true of movies themselves. Not just when it comes to the veracity of their subject matters, but the veracity of their circumstances. Because it‚Äôs so easy for people to watch a movie and just think about what the characters do within the constraints of the story itself. It becomes easy to defend their actions with a ‚Äúwell what else would you expect them to do?‚Äù as if this was all some documentary we were watching. But no, someone made the decision to create this situation. Then they made the decision to put the character in that place to make that decision. We call this ‚Äúnarrative framing‚Äù and often, that‚Äôs far more important to understanding the artistic intent.

For the most jaw-dropping examples of this dynamic, I think of the work Neil Breen. Within certain circles, he‚Äôs known as an infamous independent filmmaker who makes bizarre outsider art. In *Fateful Findings*, a [film in which](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFgQ34b96_U) he is the writer/director/producer/star, this middle aged weirdo plays a super hacker who also has ethereal superpowers and sure makes a lot of pretty women kiss him a lot. It instantly reads as creepy wish fulfillment, but if that weren‚Äôt scary enough, he is constantly having his character turn down the advances of his friend‚Äôs underage stepdaughter. He literally screams with righteous indignation, ‚ÄúI am not attracted to underage girls!‚Äù as the film shoots her seduction otherwise. The framing of this is basically one big ‚Äúuhhhhh, what the fuck, Neil? You keep saying you don‚Äôt like underage girls but literally eeeeeeeeeeverything about this is making me think otherwise.‚Äù The problem isn‚Äôt what the character is saying, the problem is the larger narrative framing makes it seem like the opposite of its intention.

That example may be jaw-dropping, but cinema is full of all sorts of hypocritical bits of lip service and unsettling desires. Something like Death Wish may position itself as a standard revenge fare, but by having the main character become little more than a vehicle for enacting violence upon minorities, it belies the intentions of the film. The problem is how easy it becomes to ‚Äúnot see‚Äù this component. We have to constantly remember that movies are powerful experiences. That they can make us feel for the character, and contort a series of circumstances that make their actions may seem completely justifiable. But to find the problems, often we do not have to look within the character.

Often we have to look at the artist that is framing them.

**3. Enter The Framer**

As *Joker*‚Äôs buzz reached a certain level, I overheard a curious remark, ‚Äúwow I didn‚Äôt know Todd Phillips had this in him!‚Äù

[Insert gif of confused girl looking off to side]

It‚Äôs weird to say ‚ÄúI did know,‚Äù but that‚Äôs only because I‚Äôve been thinking really hard about Todd Phillips for a long time now. Because he‚Äôs the outsider who came into Hollywood with a GG Allin documentarian and ended up making broad comedies. That kind of tells you a lot, but the rest of his career confirms it. If the ethos of a comedic worldview is defined by its targets, then on the surface, films like *Old School* and *The Hangover* are full of the standard stuff you would find in a Happy Madison production. The core difference is slight, but perceptible. The jokes in Phillip‚Äôs films are a bit more terse, blunt, and uncaring. The women in them are more straightforward in their characterization of being nagging, inept bores. Same goes for the strippers with non-existent agency, who only live for the placation of men. Beyond this, I‚Äôm not sure his work cares about much of anything. Life. Death. Consequence. Inconsequence. It all glides right by as mundane cares deserving of a cackle before moving on. Where the Sandler-verse at least pays lip service to family notions, there‚Äôs something infinitely more misanthropic in Phillips‚Äô work. The Ringer even had to [outright ask](https://www.theringer.com/2016/8/22/16041280/todd-phillips-characters-war-dogs-the-hangover-b4c73d7c1340#.wk774zrm8), ‚Äúare the friends in Todd Phillips movies actual friends?‚Äú And I can‚Äôt help, but muse that perhaps no filmmaker has seemed like he truly hated people across the spectrum. 

The problem is that Phillips is also a ‚Äúbetter filmmaker‚Äù than a lot of people who put out broad comedy. As a photographer, I think he‚Äôs actually got a good eye. He makes comedies that know how to keep the high-key lightness, where you can actually feel the glare of sunlight, or see a pock mark, or the sweat dripping off your brow, and often employs them to good effect. Hell, he can even make a moment of action cut together. But it has a specific effect on broad comedy you might not expect. Where a Larry The Cable Guy movie would try to land a crude joke with a lot of over-emphasis (think like a doing noise or something), Phillips uses a light touch to glide right over a groaner and make it work ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù And at the same time, he can also glide over a joke so dark it doesn‚Äôt stick out.

Like you remember how Zach Galifiankis‚Äôs character in *The Hangover* is literally a pedophile?

Yeah that funny, career-making performance of his? He‚Äôs a pedophile. It‚Äôs an [early throwaway joke](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg2b6tWrJJw) when they‚Äôre near a school and then the film just rushes right past it. Now, all of these instincts would have some kind of point if Phillips was genuinely interested in subversion. Like if he was really some Waters-esque bourgeoisie shocker, but the truth is he doesn‚Äôt really seem all that interested in it. With Phillips, it seems like his only real intention with darkness is not to talk about it, but just to embody it. He‚Äôs not doing cognitive thematic gymnastics with any of this. He [didn‚Äôt even seem to understand](https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2019/09/joker-director-why-john-wick-wasnt-met-same-scrutiny-violence?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=complexmag&amp;utm_source=twitter.com) the basic difference of the effect of violence in this film versus the violence in John Wick (short version: they‚Äôre very different). Don‚Äôt get me wrong, there‚Äôs an interesting discussion to be had there. But he‚Äôs not interested in it. He‚Äôs just nakedly equating them in a way that indicates he‚Äôs not exactly sure what he thinks of a lot of the violence in his own film. There‚Äôs no real intent for me to finger wag at him here, it just gives way to a grimmer realization.

Todd Phillips movies are popular because society can be just as cynical as he is. Or at least, society has just as many cynical parts to them. Look no further than the unending popularity of *The Walking Dead*, a piece of criticism which I‚Äôll leave to David Simon to [articulate far better](https://biblioklept.org/2012/12/18/david-simon-on-the-walking-dead-and-newtown/) than I could. And when you look at the dramatic nature of his existing photography, the cynicism at the heart of his work, and his capacity to make the dark joke that glides right by? You realize there was no one more ‚Äúqualified‚Äù to make this movie. 

You may take this sentiment to try and call me out, to proclaim ‚Äúyou didn‚Äôt like this from the start!‚Äù And so I have to reply, ‚Äúno.‚Äù Like all films, you give them a chance to surprise you. The fact is that film is so powerful a medium that they always *can* surprise you. And honestly? In some ways, Joker really did surprise me (I‚Äôll get to them soon). But in other ways, the film confirmed the very simple and obvious fact that I am making here and now: Todd Phillips is the one doing the framing.

And he has something he wants to say‚Ä¶

**4. Sympathy for the Devil**

Arthur Fleck begins the movie getting beaten up by unruly teens. 

His situation does not improve from there.

Arthur tells us that his life has been nothing but pain and we see this plainly. He suffers from a seeming number of difficult mental illnesses. He has to take a vast number of medications. His state-appointed therapist doesn‚Äôt listen to him. He lives with is mother and has to dote on her and try to make her happy. He does his unwieldy best to connect, but every second he is shunned and pushed away by those around him. They treat him as either a walking punchline or punchable object. He‚Äôs the one who is mugged and yet he is the one who has to pay for the broken sign. His coworkers lie and coerce him into bad decisions. At virtually every second of the film, Arthur is picked on, shunned, or hated. It becomes so much that it almost feels comical in its overwrought seriousness. Like in the very first scene, where Arthur lies on the ground, freshly beaten by street kids, his flower literally ‚Äúcrying‚Äù as the film‚Äôs title card hits. It‚Äôs all SO MUCH. But so is the rest of the film. And the goal of all of these choices is more than clear.

It wants you to have sympathy for Arthur. 

I choose that word carefully. I write about this notion a lot but there is a difference between sympathy, which are ‚Äúfeelings of pity and sorrow for someone else's misfortune.‚Äù and empathy, which is ‚Äúthe ability to understand and share the feelings of another.‚Äù And I think Arthur‚Äôs plight speaks to the core difference. For the magnitude of his suffering and his inability to fix it are so massive that it plunges the viewer into a sympathetic situation - one where they are watching an impossibly sad human being in an impossibly sad reality. We can relate with some of his plight, of course. I‚Äôm not trying to argue against that (in fact, I‚Äôll come to some of the core feelings we empathize with later). What I am saying is that it is not a stretch to say the film makes a concerted effort to play for your sympathies instead of create a nuanced situation that feels closer to one‚Äôs own life. And I am saying this decision is very much on purpose.

To illustrate why this matters for the narrative framing, let‚Äôs think of an apt comparison. When we watch Tony Soprano in *The Sopranos*, we are also watching the story of an anti-hero, right? He‚Äôs a gangster, a killer, and a greedy man often feeds on misery and his own incredible selfishness. But we also watch the way Tony conforms to society. He‚Äôs a husband, a father, and a friend who finds a way to have fun and engage in basic niceties. In a way, he even enjoys these pursuits. But the aim of a lot of this is to build an understanding of the link between the audience and the more down-to-earth features of his character. Heck, it‚Äôs a show where one of the very first scenes is him walking out like a schlub in his bathrobe to get the paper and there is nothing more routine in our lives than the daily mundane. 

You may worry immediately, ‚Äúoh no! Is it trying to make you empathize with that!!?!‚Äù No, what it‚Äôs trying to make you understand is that Tony‚Äôs sociopathy lies in his monstrous ability to compartmentalize. He can bounce between killing a former rat and guiding his daughter on a college trip at a moment‚Äôs notice. It‚Äôs trying to put a bright shining light on Tony‚Äôs own disconnect with the world and his situation. And it is DEFINITELY not trying to evoke a sense of sympathy for his behavior in doing so. Yes, I know that the Joker and Tony Soprano are very different characters with two very different kinds of goals. 

But I am also saying these are two different treatments get at two very different wants from the audience. Because instead of allowing us to look on and understand Arthur, the way Phillips plays so damn hard for sympathy can‚Äôt help but feel unnerving. He‚Äôs working so hard to frame a world where Arthur is trod upon for anything and everything Which makes us wonder, why does Joker want all this sympathy for the character? What is the real motivation? What does it really want from these early scenes?

Well, it wants to justify the actions that are to come‚Ä¶

**5. Justified**

Before we get there, we have to acknowledge that Arthur Fleck‚Äôs portrayal is a lot more complicated than the simple fact that ‚Äúpeople are mean to him.‚Äù In fact, the depth of Arthur‚Äôs plight deals with two amazingly complex issues.

The first is his mental illness.

While Arthur‚Äôs mental disorders are vague and numerous, the film does shed a specific light on what we know as the [Pseudobulbar affect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudobulbar_affect) or PBA, where displayed emotions are inconsistent with the actual feelings inside. I can‚Äôt speak enough to speak to the veracity of the portrayal, but what I can say is that Joaquin Phoenix is a hell of an actor. The moments, especially early on, where Arthur gets caught up in an inappropriate reaction are brought to life with heartbreaking verve. You can see the struggle on his face, the competing urges of expression and horror at tics that simply can‚Äôt be helped. You see his pain, his fear, and his worry about the misunderstanding they cause. From this we understand that Arthur genuinely cares about connecting and being understood, and these moments put forth the most humane ethos that the film has to offer (often before being shut down by others incredibly callous impunity).

Again, I want to reiterate how much of this movie is ‚Äúwell made.‚Äù The effectiveness of these tactics in terms of building sympathy is incalculable. And if there‚Äôs anything that speaks to the movie‚Äôs possible sense of heart, it is these very moments. For it captures something so honest about the way society overlooks those who don‚Äôt fit in with the standard way of life. The way those with mental illness get shuffled away. The way we avoid eye contact with homeless people. The way some people would rather do *anything* than feel a moment of uncomfort. These moments are so achingly real. The same goes for the moments where Arthur goes to see his state assigned therapist, who sees him as nothing, a cog, a file case. He asks ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt listen, do you?‚Äù And she doesn‚Äôt. And as overwrought as those systematic moments are, they still feel like the meaningful foundation of what Joker is trying to explore‚Ä¶ 

Until the film moves right past them.

Because the second Arthur‚Äôs medications get taken away, we don‚Äôt see the likely events that would happen. Yes, there is a way that the film captures a kind of manic energy and ‚Äúfreedom‚Äù that comes from going off medication, but the reality of doing so is often far more complex and unwieldy. Heck, you can‚Äôt even make the argument that going off the medication corresponds to the film‚Äôs treatment of his visions / imaginings because they start much earlier. Really, in terms of the actual depiction, all going off medication does is tap into the ugly depiction that people on medication most fear: *Arthur feels stronger and more empowered*. He‚Äôs suddenly less unburned by guilt and self-hate. He becomes assured, more calm, even better at talking. If this weren‚Äôt enough, it also flies in the face of the grim realities of PBA because it‚Äôs a neurological disorder, where the various causations don‚Äôt ‚Äúget fixed,‚Äù especially in this manner. But this part of the realism doesn‚Äôt matter, because its not what the film is really after.

In short, if *Joker* cared about mental health, it would care about it. It would go on to fuel a narrative that explores the complexity of everything I‚Äôve said here. Instead, all the struggles with mental health simply become a means to invoke sympathy and then justify his violent ends. And that would be offensive enough if it weren‚Äôt for the topic that comes next. 

Because the second plight deals with abuse.

For much of the film, we see the abuse that Arthur suffers in his day to day. Whether from coworkers or strangers, the one seeming respite is his relationship with his mother. But that of course seems fraught as well. Not just in the way that he has to dote on and take care of her as best he can. It‚Äôs the quietly oppressive sense of sunshine that she hangs over every detail of his life. She tells Arthur that he was put on earth to spread joy and laughter, which makes his life the embodiment of the ‚Äúput on a happy face,‚Äù mantra. Which ignores so many of the very real struggles he has in his day to day life. We see Arthur‚Äôs conflict. Early on, we believe he wants warmth and love. That he‚Äôs really trying to put himself out there. To make people laugh and bring joy‚Ä¶ but it doesn‚Äôt reflect the inside of what he‚Äôs feeling. And so it gets cast over him as a massive form of denial. One that will strike even deeper into the heart of his experience‚Ä¶

Because the midsection of the film actually flirts with the idea that Joker is the secret bastard love child of Thomas Wayne, meaning that he and young Bruce are brothers. At first worry, one worries that this is going to be more of Hollywood‚Äôs classist obsession with turning everything into bloodline dramas and daddy issue squabbles. Then we believe that the film is tackling the idea that powerful men use their power and money to hide abuse, insist that women make false accusations, and gaslight the whole scenario. But it‚Äôs all just a red herring, a way to build up to reveal that Arthur‚Äôs mother was indeed lying to him. Worse, that she has been hiding the tremendous abuse from Arthur that he suffered as a child.

The effect of this decision feels odd and errant. Not just in the way that it 1) makes me feel like this is so utterly inconsistent with what we‚Äôve seen in their relationship, 2) invites so many more questions about how this was accomplished and how she got him back, 3) how this absolutely validates the gas-lighting rhetoric men offer and show that women are really madwomen who need to be locked in the attic and 4) helps feed the narrative of how the whole thing only blames the mother for abuse. Hell, the boyfriend abuser is barely mentioned, nor any abuse that is directed at her. So all the ire, all the villainy, it‚Äôs all the mother‚Äôs fault for ‚Äúletting this happen‚Äù and not caring that it did.

Look, I can accept the broad strokes idea this is plot-line is likely meant to be a depiction of how ‚Äúabuse gets hidden‚Äù and putting on a happy face for the ugly things we don‚Äôt talk about. But there are so many elements about the portrayal here that feel like a vipers nest of issues in sexist rhetoric. So when it goes into the big confrontation between Arthur and his mother, I had all those questions swirling in my head, ‚ÄúHow are they going to deal with this? How is this pain and heartbreak going to get covered? How is she going to justify herself? How is the movie going to deal with this subject matter at all?‚Äù

Instead, Arthur just comes back and suffocates her immediately. 

And it really doesn‚Äôt bring up the issue again. 

He‚Äôs just free of it.

By this point, you‚Äôre probably getting a sense of the film‚Äôs modus operandi. After taking great care to set-up Arthur‚Äôs struggles with the grim realities of his life, after wringing out all the sympathy it can, it just stops engaging them. Because it has no real interest in exploring the topics. It only wants to use them. Same goes for the all the times it cherry picks when Arthur‚Äôs interiority gets explored. When you consider the framing, it‚Äôs not actually interested in any of these topics. It‚Äôs only interested in how it can use them as motivation and justification for one single purpose‚Ä¶

To shoot you in the fucking face.

**6. For Want of A Nail**

Okay, let‚Äôs cut through a lot of the bullshit. For all the lip service, for all the portents, for all the framing that tries to point you in a different direction‚Ä¶ every single image and scene in the film presents a subtext of the problem that‚Äôs *really* bothering Arthur‚Ä¶

He feels powerless

And in going through the situations described above, in stopping his medication, in murdering his mother, in shooting assholes, and in no longer being ignored, he becomes awakened to what having power feels like. The sense of freedom and control feeds him like a drug. I remember watching the subway scene, when he first lets out that angry instinct. At first, I remember first rolling by eyes at the overt bro-y-ness mixed with sadism, but you can imagine these are the kind of kids who have a certain president father. So fine, *Joker* I will accept the premise that these men are shitty. Which means I will accept them as targets. Arthur fires in defense, and then he goes after the last one for keeps. But given everything we had seen, I immediately fretted. Given everything we had seen from the character so far, from his own internal fear, to his wanting to do good and be loved, I wondered, ‚ÄúWhat would he think of what he‚Äôs just done? How does he feel about this?‚Äù

He feels like dancing, of course. All notions of introspection disappear immediately. Meaning all willingness of the film to hang its hat on something concrete go away just as quickly. You can‚Äôt even really draw a line of interpretation to the dance, other than the idea he‚Äôs going inward, and indulging the power fantasy. Which we know is true because the second he finishes, he goes off to kiss Zazie Beetz in a fit of manic confidence and energy! Which, when it happens is precisely the kind of thing that makes you yell ‚Äúoh fuck off!‚Äù at the screen (but don‚Äôt worry, we‚Äôll come back to her plot-line later). The film even confirms this intention when Arthur later says he doesn‚Äôt feel that bad about it. So what the sequences really makes me question is whether Arthur‚Äôs desire for good was ever real in the first place. If there ever a moment of being humble or actually yearning for connection. Was it all just another narrative lie? Which makes sense because all those moments so easily could have been codified as repression. All part of the story‚Äôs endless problems in framing.

Let‚Äôs take the film‚Äôs vigilante instinct itself. What‚Äôs somewhat remarkable is that this shooting scene absolutely evokes an infamous 1984 subway shooting. If you don‚Äôt know [the one I‚Äôm talking about](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_New_York_City_Subway_shooting), a person who will remain nameless was riding a subway, said he was threatened, and then shot four African-American men named Barry Allen, Troy Canty, Darrell Cabey, and James Ramseur. At first, he was hailed as a hero. A lone gunman who stood up to the influx of rampant crime that was plaguing New York City! But of course, it was just another toxic framing. With time, the real details of the event seeped out in the trial and it turns out the shooter was a devout racist who thought he was cleaning the streets of minorities. He even shot one them with malevolent verve and demented glee (then in true white supremacy fashion, he was acquitted of attempted murder). Even today, the event stands as the embodiment of racism in a nutshell; the Death Wish fantasy made real.

So of course Todd Phillips took all the meaningful details of that event and perverted it in the most confusing and self-serving way possible. You could argue the film ‚Äúsmartly‚Äù picks it‚Äôs target by moving away from Arthur targeting minorities and instead targeting rich assholes. But this is the very dishonesty I‚Äôm talking about. It‚Äôs running from the very truth of what fuels vigilantism, and more importantly, public shootings. Hell, look at this country. Look who is angry and feels powerless. Look at every active shooter in the news. It‚Äôs always been the same story of guys with entitlement getting coupled with the intersections of white supremacy. Especially because in the film‚Äôs 1981 setting, this wasn‚Äôt the story at all. Hatred of the rich wasn‚Äôt even on the to do list. Instead, society was moving toward an active embrace of the rich and Reagan era splurging. It was codifying violent crime along racial lines and praying for the kinds of draconian tactics that ‚Äúrestore order.‚Äù It‚Äôs such a stark, bold-faced inversion. 

To put it another way, do we really think Todd Phillips wants to kill the rich? Beside the fact that the dude‚Äôs worth 100 million dollars, let‚Äôs look at virtually everything we know about his work, his sound bytes, and his interests. It‚Äôs not a stretch to argue that by inverting these two realities, it creates the most disingenuous, convenient framing imaginable. It exists to create a more ‚Äúworthwhile‚Äù modern target that only serves to motivate the power fantasy at the core of the film‚Äôs true wants.

When you go back the the film‚Äôs treatment of mental health, you can see the same exact pattern. The film cherry picks with Arthur‚Äôs psychology in a way that feels deeply problematic. Yes, Arthur is in pain. This is assured. But the way this dynamic often manifests in people is with deep, unhealthy, and ingrained form of self hatred. Because the true pain about these sorts of scars is not because your life is filled with people attacking you at every second, but because of the horrible catch 22 that such abuse incurs - where you see an attack in everything, to the point that when good things happen you can‚Äôt enjoy them because they feel dishonest. Even when love is presented you reject and push it away. The film seems to argue that what Arthur eventually has is a kind of uncaring sociopathy, but this is not present for every single time the film oh-so-conveniently gives him a reason to internalize and emote, but only at the exact points it wants you to sympathize with him. In turn, all the moments where he causes violence come from the moments he conveniently disconnects from it effecting him the same way.

Arthur‚Äôs entire awakening is essentially built around the realization that, ‚Äúbeing nice is a lie.‚Äù All those moments of wanting people to give him empathy and love? What he should have done is just join the dog-eat-dog fight. Which is where we come to the ‚Äúincel‚Äù psychology of it all. Believe me, I don‚Äôt want to invoke it, but the framing taps so closely to what‚Äôs dramatized on screen. And it‚Äôs not the pain of all these people‚Äôs experiences aren‚Äôt real. It‚Äôs that the pain becomes the excuse to lash out. It‚Äôs the commonality of feeling powerless and entitled enough to turn that all into excuse to grab power and hurt others. Hell, to turn that hurt into power itself. This is why the depiction of Arthur rings so true to many people. Especially because this is what it can feel like, but the film‚Äôs motivation is able to hide underneath the false framing of social import.

Which is why the film can‚Äôt show any real moments of kindness toward Arthur because then it would let the air out of what it wants, which is for him to hurt everyone in a justifiable way. Just as the film can‚Äôt let on to the fact that Arthur‚Äôs violence secretly comes from a place of entitlement. Which makes me realize that there are two nail-based proverbs that I can‚Äôt help but think about in regards to this dynamic. The first is that ‚Äúwhen you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.‚Äù And that‚Äôs true. When you‚Äôre holding a deep, repressed anger? The things that trigger rage aren‚Äôt often the most productive applications. In fact, everything that doesn‚Äôt go your way becomes a potential trigger. This is at the root of Arthur‚Äôs nihilistic embrace of his own malice. 

But the second proverb is from ‚Äúfor want of a nail,‚Äù which seems like it may characterize the same instinct, but is actually about small actions leading to large unintended consequences. Here‚Äôs the Todd Rundgren version:

‚ÄúFor want of a nail, the shoe was lost,

For want of a shoe, the horse was lost,

For want of a horse, the rider was lost,

For want of a rider, the message was lost,

For want of a message, the battle was lost,

For want of a battle, the war was lost,

For want of a war, the kingdom was lost,

For want of a nail, the world was lost.‚Äù

I can‚Äôt help but think of the way this shows not only the nature of unintended consequences, but the way Joker‚Äôs violent actions spin out and cause untold amounts of chaos. A world that is effectively lost because of the unmooring of on one man‚Äôs malice. Only this one is so much less accidental, but the proof positive of what happens when you begin to pull the world apart piece by piece and don‚Äôt regret it. But honestly? The thoroughness of this metaphor is where it all becomes trickier. Yes, Joker has a hammer. Yes he‚Äôs looking to hit anything. Yes, this will tear the world apart. The fact the movie is so outrageously good at characterizing all this is why defenders many will argue the simple and obvious conclusion‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúThis is all on purpose!‚Äù

They will argue that everything I am saying is the point of the movie. Which is why I see the defenders of *Joker* bring out the steady stream of defenses about depiction not meaning endorsement (yeah, I know) and then make a quick comparison to how it‚Äôs like Taxi Driver. But it is actually in such comparisons that they directly betray their intention‚Ä¶

**7. Driving Taxis**

Martin Scorsese has a long and storied career making films about deplorable subjects. To be clear, he also makes incredible films about far more humane subjects, like single motherhood, the struggle of faith, the repressions of genteel society, and the joyous delights of cinema itself (please see *Alice Doesn‚Äôt Live Here Anymore, Kundun, Silence, Age of Innocence,* and *Hugo* if you haven‚Äôt). But the original statement is also true. Martin Scorsese has made a number of films about gangsters, killers, and immoral capitalist monsters. But the reason he has such critical success in portraying these subjects is because he characterizes the entire range of their seductive reality. While many would prefer a hand-wringing, finger-pointing moralistic approach, instead Scorsese has been bluntly honesty about the ways we ARE enamored with these subjects, especially as individuals. But he documents all of it: the ways we love them and also the ways they repulse us, become un-rootable-for, and cross clear moral lines. Which means he‚Äôs not only framing fairly, but doing thorough and brilliant observation.

In short, Martin Scorsese has never pulled a punch.

This is why the comparisons of *Joker* to *Taxi Driver* make me deeply uncomfortable. You could argue that Phillips‚Äô film is trying to show the whole entirety of Arthur, too. That it‚Äôs clearly showing all the reasons to love him and find him repulsive, but it comes back to the framing. To put the difference bluntly, there is no moment in *Taxi Driver* where Travis Bickle is meant to invoke your sympathy. I mean, he‚Äôs clearly a depressed, struggling young man, but there‚Äôs nothing about the opening that is meant to pile on and make his situation feel dire, nor tug at your sense of pity. More than that, De Niro‚Äôs performance puts up a clear wall with the audience, just as Scorsese‚Äôs camera keeps that same kind of distance. Between the two, it creates an ability for the audience to observe and perhaps find fascination it the subject, but that comes with the needed sense of separation from that same subject. It gives you the ability to be the artistic observer, not the sympathizer. 

Meanwhile, Phillips‚Äô camera practically fixates on Arthur. It‚Äôs interested in every single pain and slight on his face. Every little emotion and feeling is read plainly. Every shot feels like it‚Äôs Arthur‚Äôs feelings alone, as he‚Äôs looking at someone else off screen or to the edge of frame. It‚Äôs almost jarring when Bryan Tyree Henry shows up and you realize this is the first opposing character who is also given a sense of humanity (god he‚Äôs a great actor, too). And the few moments where the camera does pull away from Arthur are merely meant to also make you feel for his loneliness and isolation. So yes, the two movies may seem similar in content, but there are actually two radically different approaches here.

Note the way that Travis Bickle‚Äôs decisions also drive the action. He‚Äôs the one who goes looking for the gun. He‚Äôs the one who admits he craves violence for violence‚Äôs sake, not as revenge. He‚Äôs the one who goes looking for his own narrative in the world. And after he fails at becoming a political assassin, his ending ‚Äúsave‚Äù of Iris is where he terrifyingly frames himself a hero going to rescue the young maiden. The public‚Äôs celebration of which ends up feeling like a bitter irony against his intention. But most important is the film‚Äôs ending. Where even if he seems calm and ‚Äúcured‚Äù by this praise - his deep, unsettling urges and resentments still exist as a nagging itch in his rear view mirror. 

Meanwhile, Arthur drives so little of the action in Joker. He‚Äôs practically forced into it. The gun is handed to him. He‚Äôs assaulted to a ludicrous degree before he defends himself. Even the climactic talk show scene is so nakedly provoking. It‚Äôs as if the narrative bends over backwards to give him a justification for EVERY action he takes. Because in the end, it doesn‚Äôt actually want Arthur to feel like a victimizer. All it wants Arthur to do is slide right into his deserved place.

There is also a monumental difference in how the two films treat the side characters around their leads. As much as Taxi Driver is also full of depraved people, rarely does their depravity feel so targeted at Travis. They‚Äôre mostly living their lives and he is the one trying to insert himself. And the film actually has a huge amount of empathy for Cybil Shepard‚Äôs character. I can‚Äôt help but think about the haunting moment in the porn theater, where she realizes exactly who this guy is and his startling disconnect with what‚Äôs happening. We are suddenly TERRIFIED of this main character and his capacities (we‚Äôll get to the key difference with Zazie Beat‚Äôs character soon). But *Taxi Driver* is just full of these kind of moments where we adjust our perspective and can suddenly see the way that others see Travis. But even with the most key moments of *Joker*, rarely do we see how others see Arthur. Heck, even when he suffocates his mother, a supposed climactic moment of the film‚Äôs biggest relationship coming to a head, we only see his face as he experiencing the joy of an angry catharsis.

Which all just proves, yes, problematic framing can often be literal. And when we talk about depiction and endorsement, these small differences matter so much. Because it leaves me to question the entire point of not only Arthur‚Äôs understanding of himself (which is clearly confused), but the film‚Äôs understanding of him as well. There‚Äôs even a point where Arthur muses to his psychologist that ‚Äúhe doesn‚Äôt feel like he exists.‚Äù But given every second of the film, it feels like a dangerous reframing of the situation at hand. Because all the film does is fixate on Arthur‚Äôs own emotions and perspective. So it feels like it‚Äôs being dishonest about the way we are really looking at this character. It‚Äôs not that he doesn‚Äôt exist‚Ä¶

It‚Äôs that *no one* else really matters.

Hollywood should make a Godfather prequel about Michael Corleone's time in WW2,"With the talent that exists today, who else thinks this could be a good idea? 

Making a film centred around Michael's time in WW2 could be a gripping war film without tainting the legacy of the original films. We know that Michael is ruthless in the films, I think it isn't a stretch to say this could be because of his time in WW2. 

This idea came to my head when I watched The Irishman. It's such an epic and sprawling story, yet De Niro's character probably has lived through another amazing story during his time in WW2.

It would be highly interesting to see a good WW2 film about Michael, knowing that same man would then go on to become the Don Corleone from the films. Perhaps the film could be titled 'Corleone', or 'Corleone: A Godfather Story"".",movies,1579466412,Throwaaygf7yhk,28,1,True,2020-01-19

Turbo the movie," 

For those who do not remember, Turbo was a movie from 2013, about... snails going fast.

Yeah, i know... not quite a stunning premise and it sure showed, barely getting 65% on rotten.

It made 282m by a budget of 135m. For comparison: Zootopia cost 150m and made 1024mil!

Anyhow, there is **ONE REDEEMING ELEMENT** in this mess, which somehow got little attention and i think it would make for a quite good movie!

Within the movie, we get to see a B story about **2 human brothers.**  
One trying to stick to the basics, while the other has inventive (and risky) business ideas for their Taco diner. The two are constantly arguing for about the money and how they want to handle things... and i have to admit, i liked it!

**I was WAY MORE interested in how those stay afloat than the life of stupid snails!**

It's a no brainer we can relate more to humans and given those are brothers which work a 'low budget' job (which got little appreciation) ... HELL... we all been there! We all had to work lousy jobs at some point (or still do) ... and while we do all of that, somehow get along with our family and friends!

I say it again: that's something most of us can relate to! This can give a simple premise weight.

Pretty much all Disney movies have very rememberable characters. I bet you could count 10 of the top of your head within a few seconds! So let's move away from generic and cliche ""brave hero snail"" to ""3-dimensional humans"" (which happened to be CGI, so no pun intended)...

ps. a hint when it comes to comedy: **a joke doesn't make a character, but character makes the jokes!**

Or in other words: cut out the stereotypes! BayMax was full of them... Cars was full of them and the SNAILS sure were full of them. At least give them something to elevate themselves from the rest! I don't want to see the 'cool' friend and the 'nerd/emo' friend and the 'muscle guy brainless' friend showing up &lt;.&lt; tough love here! and don't you dare to do the 'wants all the money business guy' ...

All can have flaws, strengths, dreams, thoughts, and their own hopes... -and grow along the way.

SO\~ lets see you in cinemas in ... 202x

Rocky V is as good as the others if not better than some.,"Despite the fact that Rocky V has by far the worst rating out of all the movies in the series on imdb (5,3 with the next one being Rocky III with 6,8) I think it is in fact at least on par with the whole series if not even a stand out.

Why? In my opinion the storyline in Rocky V is the most complex and worked out of all in the series, Rocky faces bankruptcy, retirement, moving back to the old neighborhood, there is father-son relationship building which we didn't have in the previous ones and then there is of course the focal point of the movie, the relationship with Tommy Gunn, for whom he gave his heart in training and ended up betrayed (kind of reminiscent of the relationship between Obi Wan and Anakin in Revenge of the Sith). Compared to the other movies which mostly focused on one thing per movie (Rocky: a nobody got a chance for the title and took it; Rocky II: the challenge of preparing for a rematch while having family trouble; Rocky III: the challenge of preparing for a rematch while mourning after a lost friend; Rocky IV: the challenge of preparing for a match while grieving for a lost friend), one can see the plot is leaning more towards a classic motion picture drama than a training montage with some story put in there.",movies,1579468757,OriginalHairyGuy,30,1,True,2020-01-19

I find her pretty funny, and she did have some development in her movie by realizing that she was  trapped by her team, and decided to fight them back.

Ratatouille and Up aren't just great animated films, they are excellent films in general. Spiderverse is great in its genre but in general its good but not THAT good.

Hell even if someone prefers Spiderverse to those movies i would understand but UP??? Thats just too much imo. Up literally premiered at Cannes and scored a best picture nom ffs, it really is not on spiderverses level in any way.

"The Host, a 2006 South Korean film, is one of the greatest monster movies of all time.","If you've never seen *The Host* and you're even a casual fan of monster movies or horror films in general, you are doing yourself a great disservice to miss it.  It's a quirky, unusual and sometimes even quite frightening film, featuring a very original and inspired twist on the movie monster genre.  *The Host* focuses on a small family of lovable and interesting misfits living in South Korea, who's lives are forever altered once they face the titular monster.  This focus on family is what gives this movie its heart and soul; the characters are so real and fleshed out here that the stakes of the film become real, and the story has weight and consequence.  For an added layer of depth through metaphor, each member of the family can be understood as a symbolic representation of the virtue and honor of the past, the tumultuous and fractured present, and the hopeful and inspiring future of the country that they live in.

I won't spoil the movie here, but its messages are right on point with environmental impacts and overarching geopolitical concerns. The film is even strangely prophetic regarding the subject of governmental subjugation of the people. It also deals directly with the anarchy and treachery of a panicked populace, and the lonely survivalism that comes with the mission of bringing a family back together in the midst of chaos.  The unusual and riveting monster of *The Host* is a true and original cinematic achievement in itself, and there is nothing quite like it in its genre.  Oddly enough, it has character and resonance, and may or may not be a *very* skillful bit of symbolism for a great and powerful country, seen now as a gluttonous invader in a foreign land, consuming and killing wantonly and without human regard.  All in all, *The Host* is also a slice of life view of the world of South Korea; it's land and cityscapes are wonderfully strange but still familiar, and it's apparent that the director created this film as a love letter to his homeland.  I hope anyone who hasn't seen this amazing and original film gives it a try, and I don't think you'll be disappointed with it if you do.",movies,1576807425,WanderingRoninXIII,27,1,True,2019-12-19

- The fact that it's not all swords and you see many polearms and stuff, also giving Henry a war hammer against people in plate armour is fantastic.
- That despite in real history the dauphin was not present, they still included him as he was probably be far the most interesting character 
- I also like the unhistorical assassin plot. Despite some people dislikingb the unrealism as it portrays Henry as not wanting to go to war with France (which he did) and being easily fooled, it actually allowed me to connect more with someone who didht want to wage war while still giving him a reason to, also I personally didnt think it made him seem incompetent. Hes completely new to being a king and there's not much to go off of to know if the assassin was fake. So I like the sub plot and the twist at the end.
- The tactics may not be 100% historical but for a movie trying to look good they dud far better than many other medieval movies.

**What I disliked**
- The siege could have been far more of an interesting scene. Like the real history of the siege is more cinematic than what the movie depicts
- Henry is such a meh character, like I still enjoyed him but he seemed devoid of character amd personality 
- While armour is good in this movie it still could have fit better to peoples bodies, also there could be a bigger variety of period armour
- They perpetuate the myth ofvtheirvheing no colour in the medieval period. I get that the literal cinematography is a bit dark to reflect the atmosphere amd mood of the movie but still the clothing and castles of the rich were colorful af.
- The dauphin slipping in the mud felt a bit forced and I would have preferred if they had him just slip a tiny bit to show hes clumsy but not a complete dork, or just had him not fight at all as it didnt seem to fit his character to roll up like that.
- His wife seemed a bit bitchy, now I'm all for adding a tiny bit of modern day sentiment to historical movies so you can relate a bit better but cmon that felt way too empowering for a medieval girl who just had her king husband kill her brother amd take over her country. A like a bit of the zest she has but it feels like its just trying to appeal to woman empowerment in a time where that would very much not happen.",movies,1576807746,-Constantinos-,9,1,True,2019-12-19
Actors you're surprised never got bigger than they did,"It might be weird to use this actress as an example because she's a pretty big star and honestly more famous than many actors would ever hope to be but...is it me or does it seem like Jennifer Hudson could've had a bigger career? Most of her movies post-Dreamgirls have been independent films and the ones that did it make to a wide release only have her in a supporting role (Sex and the City, Three Stooges, Sing, and \*sigh\* Cats come to mind). And I can't really name many songs she performed outside of a movie that are big hits, despite her amazing singing voice.",movies,1576807815,mranimal2,460,1,True,2019-12-19

"I consider myself a movie (shows included) critic, according to my taste which is described below, what would you recommend me? Serious, long post","First, I have to say that for a long time I thought that TV was worse than movies, and I can understand that even with good shows like Breaking bad, it is good but just a tv show. And the first season of true detective is weird, it's really good, but I don't consider as good as what I am going to talk about now.

So, there are other shows that I consider actually better than movies, amazingly most of them come from HBO, they help you connect with the characters way way more than in any movie or trilogy of movies, and amazingly they don't have any fillings. I'm taling about: **Mad Men, The Sopranos, Band of Brothers, Rome, Seinfeld, Curb your Enthusiasm** and I would add GoT but it got horribe at the end.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, as you can see with my shows selection I don't have a particular genre, and that's the reason why I hate searching or googling for recommendations, if I liked the Sopranos someone would recommend me another mob show, I don't want that! Actually the sopranos was so good that killed the mob genre for me, but what I want is something as good as the sopranos, as human, that I connect so much with the characters and get invested. 

So something to me that is a good recommendation after watching The Sopranos is Seinfeld, even though it has nothing to do genre-wise, Seinfeld is a masterpiece, and so it's The Sopranos. **I want other things as good, or more, not similar things of worse quality**

So, I hope you can recommend me a good show, my favorite one from the ones I listed should be Mad Men, I love the other shows, but I'm so tired of guns, and violence and things I don't deal with in real life. I wouldn't mind a show set in the past, but I would actually enjoy more something set in the present or the recent past, the less guns, the more similar to my life the better, I loved the shit out of Mad Men becuase it felt real, and human. 

One of my biggest fears is that I've watched so many good shows already that there are none left, none at that quality at least. Band of Brothers, even though it's short, it's to me as good as the other shows I posted, thank god I watched it!

So that's about the shows I love, hopefully you can recommend me something as good, not similar necessarily.

&amp;#x200B;

And about movies, it's harder to name my favorites, but I love **Taxi Driver, The  Royal Tenenbaums, Call Me By Your Name, Inglorious Basterds, Annie Hall, The Princess Bride, Blue Valentine, Whiplash, Dead Poets Society, Brokeback Mountain, The Godfather, Harry Potter, The Lord of the Rings, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, Inside Llewying Davis, Inside Out, The Lion King, The Lobster, The Matrix (only the 1st obviously), The Wolf of Wall Street and There Will Be Blood and I'm not sure if to add La Vie D'Adele.**

I think it's easier to find movies to watch, since for example I can go to a lot of those directors and check out what else they have done, I've only watched one Woody Allen movie for example, and loved the shit out of it, it really blew my fucking mind. But well, since you can see I don't really have a genre, I just love good movies, I would love to know movies that are equally good in your opinion, becuase again, whenever I search for movies as good as taxi driver, i find a lot of shit, that is similar, but not as good.

&amp;#x200B;

But the movies is more an added question, since I saw the opportunity here, but I'm more concerned baout finding good shows, as I already said I'm afraid that there aren't any more shows at that level, which would make sense because shows are harder to produce it takes more time, and also i consume them really quickly, so I will run out of them sooner than movies.

But I hate how whenever I google best shows ever, I see Breaking bad before Band of Brothers, and that's just not true, I liked breaking bad, but it is full of fillings, and it isn't even remotely as good as Band of Brothers, which also gets points for being based on real life events. So perhaps there are gems out there, but nothing like Mad Men, that famous, I guess if there are good shows that good, they have to be smaller ones, mini series like Band of Brothers, **hidden gems,** and that's why I made this post",movies,1576810831,thewickedalf,0,1,True,2019-12-19
Hot take on the actual plot of TENET,"After being recruited by a super cool secret agency (maybe dubbed ""The After-Life"" cuz Nolan cheese), the lead's first mission involves experiencing the end of time as we know it. Nolan establishing stakes told visually and with loud horns/synths because he loves that shit.

Knowing this has both already happened and will happen, he obtains the ability to (possibly catalyzed by the time-ending event) move ""forwards"" back into time. He and his buddy Edward Cullen utilize this to trace back the mystery of it all to the source/recursion point - and once they figure out how to stop it, have to return back to where their journey began if they hope to save the day/time/Nolan's ego.",movies,1576811356,SeraphX17,5,1,True,2019-12-19

Disney definitely makes more movies for little girls than they do for boys.,"I've been watching a lot of movies with my 1.5 year old son since I got the Disney app about a month ago and I noticed there really isn't any movies meant for little boys. Most of the movies that are not generic (like 101 dalmatians or rescuer rangers) are all meant for little girls. They are all about some girl or princes being strong lead females but there is not the equivalent for boys. The only one I can really say would be The Sword in the Stone that was made in the 1960s.

Do you think the internet and social media have had a positive or negative impact on how we experience and think about movies?,"Or if you think there are some positives and some negatives what are they? 

&amp;#x200B;

This post is inspired by the release of Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker and how polarized it seems people have been with their opinions of the last handful of Star Wars movies. I also noticed this with Game of Thrones' final season. I personally don't have any gripes about any of them and just enjoy seeing the stories continue, however that may be. I think part of the reason is that I go into almost every movie and TV show without expectations to a large extent. It seems like people absorb the negative reviews and go into the movie with their mind already set on disliking many movies these days. 

&amp;#x200B;

I used to see almost every movie released in theaters when I was in high school because I worked at a movie theater. I started to find that the movies I enjoyed most were those that I went in with literally no expectations. I know it's hard to do that sometimes, but it just hurts me to see how invested and angry people get when a story doesn't go the way they dreamed it would go. If I ever voice a positive outlook on The Last Jedi or Game of Thrones my friends/coworkers just fucking attack like it's a decision on foreign policy lol 

&amp;#x200B;

So that's my answer - I think it has had a negative impact because you almost get a hive mind effect where people's enjoyment of a movie is influenced before they even see it. That being said, the internet has obviously help more people enjoy movies via streaming which I think is awesome.",movies,1576821032,TheMullHawk,1,1,True,2019-12-20

The garrison has landed, People hug, kiss and celebrate.

A view over of every planet seen being freed from the Final Order's ships. And celebrating cheers and music plays, A viewover of Jakku (scavengers cheer with fresh food in their hands as confetti sprinkles the sand), Canto bite (the creatures run free and the three children cheer as festivities continue), Crait (the natives celebrate at the old rebel base marking it as a landmark) takodana (people cheers drinks as more confeti flies and the ships fall), Ach-to (natives restore their temples as they cheer), Dquar (rebels hug and celebrate), Paasana (natives rejoin their dance celebration as confeti and ships fall) Kijimi (finally freed and children return home confeti and final order ships fall) Curuscant (final order ships fall into a sea of cheers and confetti) Endor (ewoks look on and celebrate with bright fires and drums as the ships fall) , and lastly tatooine (which has celebrations and confetti as the millennium falcon passes over)¬†

(the music quiets as Rey gets off her ship and explores around)

Span to Rey. On Tatooine, at the home of Luke Skywalker

She buries Luke and Leia's lightsaber and ignites her own gold one.

A wanderer asks who she is.

""I am Rey"" As she looks over to the horizon seeing the force ghosts on Luke and Leia, and as they fade she smiles, and Ben Solo slowly appears and nods approvingly.¬†

In the movie Kristoff is constantly insinuating things between him and ana (just for reference the scene where elsa and olaf fall asleep in the carridge and ana ask's him what he wants to do and puckers her lips, why is this even here?) and he asks her to marry him at one point. this may just be my opinion but a movie meant for kids that are like 6-10 don't need any of that. I may be over paranoid but i think there's no need to put things like that in kids movies i think that the parents should be the one to teach them about relationships and such its 

TL:DR movies for kids should be just that, for kids

"(Late to the party, I know but) I just finished reading the first Hunger Games book and realized how god awful the movies are.","I never thought they were great. Entertaining, but none kept my attention throughout except Part 2 of the last one, and that was mostly because the actions scenes were decent enough and the pacing wasn't too bad. But I never felt interested in the books because the movies didn't make them look appealing. 

Last year, a friend of mine who I'd never expect to like them raved about the books. He just didn't seem like the type who'd be into preteen action/romance. I added the first one to my kindle app and forgot about it. Super bored so I picked it up yesterday. Ended up binging it and finished earlier today. Just wow! I can't believe how bad the movies screwed it up. Not the story, but the entire tone!! 

The book is this gruesome survivalist story; like Deliverance, but in a dystopian future world. It's a telling of what horrible things humans can be brainwashed into accepting normal everyday life by societal standards. She does such an excellent job bouncing from one emotion to another in a complex scenario where there's so many factors to consider. Explaining her thinking in such a human way -my favorite is when Kat takes a shower on the train ride home and, when she walks out, she feels like the person she had to be for the last few weeks washed away with it. She can't even look at Peeta anymore without an almost disgust because the person she washed is the one that cared for him the most. Just finally coming out of the shock, like after a very bad car crash- 

I get trying to make it for a wider audience, but Jesus Christ. They could've just toned down the gore, they didn't need to suck the Lord of the Flies out of it and turn this story about survival into a preteen action movie. I tried watching it again to see if I'd like it better now that I understood it, but it made me hate it more!

Side note: J. Law is great in it. I think the main casting was good overall. Just an awful script and a studio that tried to capitalize on the void left by Harry Potter ending. (Which, I guess, they were.)",movies,1576826440,Space_For_Rent,24,1,True,2019-12-20

Renounce Disney Star Wars," 

![gif](rdqp4oylyq541)

Due to Disney's incompetence in the writing and handling of the Star Wars IP I have decided to henceforth consider them as bad fan-fic and ignore them. In their place I reinstate the EU to the Star Wars cannon as far as the fandom is concerned. While Disney owns the rights to the IP and can say whatever they want about what is cannon and not, they don't speak for me and i'd rather have all the EU than their lazy movie writing and comic art theft. So please join me as I pretend this is all a bad dream and go back to the way things were before Disney Star Wars.

TENET Discussion,"Here's what i worked out so far from all the marketing we got.

The main character has a mission in the beginning. He dies. Only to be woken up to work for a time travel agency. 

It's a government or high corporate project. Very lucrative.  
The mechanics of the action:

So obviously, it's time travel.   
But It's linear time travel. Meaning (like Primer) you can't go into the future, cause...Well in a way, we're already moving into the future. However. You can go back! And you do this either by entering a machine. Or using those gas masks seen in the trailer. It's like this, if you want to go three hours into the past, you have to WAIT THOSE THREE HOURS OUT while time reverses. You experience everything going backwards. But everything doesn't experience you, cause, you're coming from the future (Or they experience you in vice versa as well). A very simple gimmick once you wrap your mind around it.

So even this reverse thing has a time limit before everything starts ticking normally forwards.   
Analyze the car chase. You see Washington and Pattinson driving backwards, relative to everyone else. The car flips, as they drive backwards from it. But they experience it forwards.  
The palindrome of this is that we see the same event from both ends. Probably for most of the movie with bigger set pieces.

The ""Worse than WWIII"" line indicates to me that the good guys are trying to prevent bad terror events that will lead to the ending of the world. And the bad guys are trying to entirely undo history or historical figures or events.   


And I bet you that when Washington ""Dies"" in the movie, he literally ends up dead, but he's himself reversed, perhaps even maybe cursed to live under the rule that everything around him is going backwards. Sound's like a good Nolanesque-Cursed-Protagonist thing he'd do.  

And we all know how the Dream Within a Dream thing became a huge meme and iconic part of Inception in 2010.   
Well how about for 2020. A Causality Loop Within a Causality Loop? Groovy right? The budget is 225mil. He's gonna go as insane as possible, we all know it.",movies,1576835921,Cliff-Fuckin-Booth,0,1,True,2019-12-20

2. Why does it seem IMDB has close to 10x if not 100x the audience reviews as Rotten Tomatoes? Is it just that much more popular?

An idea for how to fix spider Man 3 slighty,"So my idea is pretty much ,cut the entire randomly place battle scene with sandman and venom at the end, the way the movie should have ended was with Peter in the clock tower tearing off the symbiote and as it eventually envelops eddie, when he lunges at the screen ,cut to black and credits, would of set the movie up for a sequel while also avoiding the quick development of venom and given a bit more development to sand man and James Franco's new goblin in the intro of the next movie while giving venom most of the development,of course I know this won't fix spider Man 3 as a whole but I know raimi wanted nothing to do with venom.

A casual moviegoer's thoughts on Star Wars: TROS.,"I've seen plenty of reviews on TROS online, and most of them only appear to discuss various plot points or creative decisions that they don't agree with. Other than Jeremy Jahns, I felt like no reviewer reviewing the film objectively as a film by itself. As someone who is very into Star Wars Lore, here are my thoughts. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Incredibly bad pacing and editing. I don't understand why the editing was so schizophrenic from start to finish. Very hectic and rushed. The audience were never allowed to absorb the emotional beats that they were going for. I felt like there was a screen wipe every 1 minute and it was seriously reminiscent of the editing style of the Transformers movies. 
* Writing and screenplay. The writing was really bad. Characters that were supposedly killed off were revealed to be alive just 10mins later. Character interactions were very unnatural. Like, most of the dialogue were exposition dumps. These were not how 2 human beings are supposed to interact. You can tell they were speaking sentences just to further the plot, to set up the next scene etc. Which is never a good way to write a movie. 
* Chris Terrio - My points about writing and screenplay above mostly comes down to his responsibility. This guy is the writer for BvS and Justice League. Both movies which had bad writing and screenplay. He won a Gold Raspberry Award for Worst Screenplay for BvS. Why did disney hire this man to do the screenplay? 

Plot points that confused/underwhelmed me:

* Movie never explained how Palpatine survived his death in ROTJ.  They just crammed his return in the opening text crawl.
* Kylo Ren - I get that they wanted to make him more intimidating in the vein of Darth Vader. But he just went around force strangling his workers for no reason and it was quite funny tbh. No set up was given for the sudden hard u-turn for his character. I found it to be very jarring.
* Movie never explained what Finn wanted to say to Rey.
* The forced ending. There was just a random lady standing in the middle of nowhere just so she can ask a question and prompt the ending dialogue.

Overall, i give this movie a 4/10. It gave me the same headache i felt with Transformers movies due to its unrelenting pace. And any movie that makes me physically ill has serious issues.",movies,1576847303,Tropez92,0,1,True,2019-12-20

First problem with my star wars showing: 2 chicks in the back with loud obviously fake laughter any time anything unique or silly or with gravity happened in the movie. They were there to mock it. They started less than 5 minutes in and it probably happened 10-15 times. Thats just insensitive.

Second problem: everyone loudly discusses the movie and all the important stuff as they walk out....past the people who are more than likely going to see the movie.

Watched an early screening of Uncut Gems and got mixed feelings about it.,"Overall the movie was good but not as good as the reviews made it out to be. Sand man was pretty solid and even though I love his performance in Punch Drunk Love, I think this was his best dramatic performance. Fell in love with Julia Fox &amp; hope she gets more roles. The movie lacked something that Good Time had and really don‚Äôt get the hype behind this movie. Good Time felt way more intense &amp; electric than Uncut Gems. 

However, I loved the ending as it did throw me off. It‚Äôs a 7/10 but will watch it again in few months.",movies,1576855020,whodoesntlovedogs,12,1,True,2019-12-20

Watching 300 (2006) as my 300th film,"Just to add some fun to my movie-watching experience, like watching Home Alone (1990) when I‚Äôm actually home alone near Christmas.

Or 300 (2006) as my 300th film.

Or The 400 Blows (1959) as my 400th film.

Or 500 Days of Summer (2009) as my 500th film.

What is this movie called?,"Hi all!  


So I remember back maybe 14-17 years ago I watched what I thought was a documentary on TV. It turned out to be a movie filmed like a documentary and it was amazing. I'm now trying to find it again but with no luck - maybe someone here can help.  


The plot is a man (may be ex military) that has lost his wife in the 9/11 attack (she was on one of the planes) and he's filled with rage so he gathers a small group of friends and hires a guy to film their trip and they travel to afghanistan to hunt taliban on their own. It's extremely convincing and as far as I remember they all end up dying.

Shot Caller on N4909tflix is the most stupid piece of SH3T movie I have seen in my life,"First of all the guy has a 16 month sentence for a Drunk driving accident. But then he decides to stab some guy and get it extended to 7 years. What kind of moron does that. He then disowns his son.

Now after he gets out of jail after 7 years this retard decides to get involved in a highly illegal gun deal that would probably put him in jail for 20 years. He kills a snitch then snitches on him self to go back to prison to kill the guy who ""threatened"" his family.

Doesn't this moron realize America is a huge country and he and his family could just move or hide away.

The movie is garbage and should not be watched under any circumstances.

The only way this movie could be good is if he ended up getting killed in the fight with the beast at the end.

Everything is moving, everything is extremely zoomed in and tunnel visioned, and it cuts way to much for me to be able to figure out what is happening, it's just a series of poorly filmed stunts and 8 second dialouges seemingly put randomly after eachother.

1. Close encounters of the third kind

I just find it slow and boring and the dialogue is very mumbly so it‚Äôs hard to follow and the characters are uninteresting. The effects haven‚Äôt aged well either compared to some other old sci fi movies.

2. Dunkirk

Unlike close encounters being too slow Dunkirk is a bit too FAST paced and that makes it even harder to follow. The characters are underdeveloped and forgettable (I don‚Äôt even remember their names) and overall it‚Äôs just a typical war movie that people only like for the technical aspects.

"[OC] Why ""Rise"" Should Be an Executive's Least Favorite Word","With Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker releasing this weekend, it's time to revisit a long list of sequels sharing the same subtitle naming convention. Many movie-buffs will argue that ""Rise of blah blah blah"" is uninspired and generic phrase to use as a subtitle, the numbers suggest it also has a critical and financial correlation to the film's success. That's to say, on average movies with ""Rise"" in the subtitle have 16% worse reviews and a whopping 31% worse box office. 

To come up with these numbers I looked at the 7 modern sequels with ""rise"" somewhere in the subtitle and compared their IMDB, Rotten Tomatoes Critics, Rotten Tomatoes Users, Metacritic and Domestic Box Office\* numbers against their predecessor. While 2/7 managed to get slightly better reviews, all 7 saw between 10 and 70% box office declines. 

&amp;#x200B;

|**Film**|**Prior Film in Series**|**Diff- Reviews**|**Diff-Box Office**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|The Dark Knight Rises|The Dark Knight|\-6%|\-16%|
|300: Rise of an Empire|300|\-26%|\-49%|
|Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines|Terminator 2: Judgement Day|\-30%|\-27%|
|Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer|Fantastic Four|\+12%|\-15%|
|Underworld: Rise of the Lycans|Underworld: Evolution|\+6%|\-26%|
|Hannibal Rising|Red Dragon|\-39%|\-70%|
|Star Wars: Rise of Skywalker|Star Wars: The Last Jedi|\-30%|\-11%\*\*|

"You guys helped me make a Rubber Reality list of films, and it's completed, so I thought I would share!","100% - if you think of something else, I want to add it. It's a delight to figure out my favorite genre of films, like this. Especially because rubber reality is a parent to all genres... they can be drama, comedy, sci-fi, action, horror, etc. It's so fun! Not sure how trafficked this sub is, and my original post was about a week ago. Sorry if this is too soon! =)

 [http://www.unclefishbits.com/reality-ever-started-unraveling-fast-can-barely-keep-let-alone-survive-well-movies-thats-rubber-reality-genre-works/](http://www.unclefishbits.com/reality-ever-started-unraveling-fast-can-barely-keep-let-alone-survive-well-movies-thats-rubber-reality-genre-works/) 

\---

I recently set out to identify a genre of films that is diverse, broad, but badass in delivering everything I personally want out of a film. They can be comedies like [Groundhog Day](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/groundhog-day), time paradoxes like [Triangle](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/triangle-2009) or [Timecrimes](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/timecrimes), or horror films where you just basically need to survive while trying to figure out what is happening, like [The Void](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/the-void-2017-0), [Existenz](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/existenz), and the like.¬† So with Reddit‚Äôs help, I compiled a list.

I might say this is the most complete list of ‚ÄúRubber Reality‚Äù genre films that has ever been compiled! =)

For a little background, in general rubber reality (AKA expanding reality, collapsable reality, alternative reality) films are where it starts out in a generally acceptable version of reality, and then the characters are sort of thrust into dealing with both staying alive, whilst watching the entirety of their universe and reality begin to collapse, at almost incomprehensible speeds. I was joking that the new Driver / Johannsen Netflix ‚Äú[Marriage Story](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/marriage-story)‚Äù could count (watched it, tho not my normal type of movie. It was absolutely brilliant, and it‚Äôs amazing‚Ä¶ reminds me of powerful and boring 1970s/80s character studies). I do think this list is going to be more Lovecraftian, in a sense, and yes I am super excited about Cage‚Äôs new ‚Äú[Color Out of Space](https://youtu.be/agnpaFLo0to)‚Äú.

If you haven‚Äôt seen [Mandy](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/mandy-2018) yet, and don‚Äôt like Quentin Tarantino (the Director is named Panos Cosmatos) on Acid &amp; Gore, just watch [the bathroom scene](https://vimeo.com/320228756).

A really easy and accessible one is [Deep Rising](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/emergence-des-profondeurs), which actually became a comedy as everyone tried to just deal with WTF. lol

[Annihilation](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/annihilation) could be one, but honestly they \*aren‚Äôt\* dealing with the collapsing reality. They‚Äôre just sort of passive observers of it. And this is one of my favorite movies in recent memory, BTW FWIW.

I wonder if [Aniara](https://www.justwatch.com/us/movie/aniara) would count? ouch.

So without further speculation, a wonderful list of mind-bending and reality ending films.

nb: I hyperlinked to what has been a life changing app/service for me, which automatically hones in what service it is streaming on for free, or where you can rent/buy. It‚Äôs an aggregator that lets you even filter by service, year, etc. It‚Äôs unbelievable, and I‚Äôve no investment or interest in the company other than finding it REALLY useful, and an easy way to catalog and figure out what content you want to watch. Cheers!

&amp;#x200B;

BEST ADVICE: If don‚Äôt know anything about the film, just take a leap and don‚Äôt spoil by reading the synopsis.

For these sort of films, the less known, the better. I‚Äôll likely move this into a spreadsheet and add subgenre (action, horror, drama), and actors.

It's been 10 years since Brittany Murphy passed away.,"Today marks the 10 year anniversary of Brittany Murphy's untimely passing. I remember back in the day when I heard she passed away, my day was destroyed. I was 12 years old at the time and I was a huge fan of her.

I haven't seen many films she starred in, but I loved her performance from *Clueless* (1995), *Girl, Interrupted* (1999), *Riding in Cars with Boys* (2001) and *8 Mile* (2002). I personally think *Spun* (2002) was her best work. Also, *Just Married* (2003) is the one movie that made me my crush on her.

I wonder what would Brittany Murphy have done in her career if she had lived?",movies,1576871960,prolelol,182,1,True,2019-12-20

Answering some common questions from ‚ÄúThe Rise Of Skywalker‚Äù (Spoilers),"‚Ä¢At the end of the movie Rey creates a yellow lightsaber (although we don‚Äôt actually se her forge it) which may indicate that she will use it in her future adventures
‚Ä¢Red (the dark side of the force) and blue (the light side) combine to make yellow (her light saber color) which indicates that Rey has brought balance to ten force
‚Ä¢It is revealed that Leia was training to be a Jedi, but chose not to complete her training (This was revealed in the Star Wars comics, Cannon to be specific)
‚Ä¢Emperor Palpatine is Rey‚Äôs grandfather
‚Ä¢Palpatine has been creating a huge fleet of Star Destroyers, each with Planet killing weapons attached 
‚Ä¢Palpatine had created Snoke and indirectly controlled him during ‚ÄúThe Last Jedi‚Äù
‚Ä¢Rey has a fight with Kylo Ren on the crashed Death Star and when Kylo Ren is about to strike her down, Leia dies. Kylo sensing this is shocked and Rey uses the opportunity to drive a lightsaber into his chest
‚Ä¢Rey, like Kylo, realizes seconds later that Leia has died and in regret, heals Kylo Ren and takes his ship and leaves.
‚Ä¢Kylo Ren, still on the Death Star sees Han Solo (most likely as a force ghost) and Han talks to him and manages to bring him to the light side ‚Äúkilling‚Äù Kylo Ren and bring back his true son Ben
‚Ä¢Ben then throws his lightsaber into the waves and renounced the first oder and everything he stood for
‚Ä¢Rey‚Äôs healing ability comes from the ability to cheat death. Cheating death originates from the dark side which she inherited from Palpatine
‚Ä¢Just when it seems the Resistance has lost, the  call for help was answered and ships from all parts of the galaxy arrive. Together with the Resistance they defeat the empire


And lastly, my own favorite part of the whole move is when Palpatine has drawn most of Rey‚Äôs life force out of her, and all the deceased Jedi talk to her, some being Yoda, Mace Windu, and Obi-Wan. They inspire her and she stands up, using Luke‚Äôs and Leia‚Äôs lightsabers to absorb Palpatine‚Äôs lighting and use it against him.

I thought the film was almost the perfect way to end the Skywalker saga.

Can I share my thoughts on The Swan Princess (1994)?,"When I was little, I loved the Swan Princess, but now that I'm older I realized just how awful it is!

The songs are unbearable, the characters are stupid, especially Derek, the story is just sickly sweet that it is just so bad! 

Disney would've done a better job with this, cut out the sickly sweet storyline and such and maybe stick more closely with the ballet Swan Lake. 

Sorry, I just want to get it off my chest because videos of this disaster keep showing up on my YouTube recommendations.

But holy shit it's exhausting. I'm never going to watch Die Hard for Christmas because all I can think about is how opinionated people get about it. It ruins it.

I actually mean what I said when I said it's more annoying than impeachment opinions, because the Die Hard/Christmas thing comes up EVERY YEAR, and will likely be debated as long as pineapple/pizza debate lasts.

Parasite - a question on something that doesn‚Äôt make sense to me... possibly an overlooked detail (spoilers),"This movie has been on my mind a bit, and thought of a detail that didn‚Äôt tie out.

Shouldn‚Äôt the daughter Da hye have seen the open door to secret chambers when she found her tutor Ki woo in the basement cellar? She found him and brought him up... no way to miss that open door.

Only explanation I can think of is either she‚Äôs traumatized or she‚Äôs so unfamiliar with the basement that she doesn‚Äôt know what it should look like.

Christmas Movie Nostalgia and the Snowman (1982),"As the holiday season gets closer and closer to the big day (merry almost Christmas to anyone who celebrates, and a nappy almost Hanukkah to anyone who celebrates that, etc. for Kwanza/Solstice/just a nice winter) I want to talk about what Christmas movies and specials make you feel warm and fuzzy inside.

While it came out long before I was born, the Snowman (1982) perfectly encapsulates the childhood spirit of Christmas for me. It warms my heart and I never fail to shed a tear during Walking in the Air just because of how beautiful it is. It's available for free on Youtube too, with both the original Raymond Briggs version that I prefer and the David Bowie version, which is also lovely. I'm not sure if linking that defies piracy rules for the sub or not. 

I was so sad to do a search of the sub and see this lovely special was barely mentioned. It is the pinnacle of Christmas to me.

"In National Treasure: Book of Secrets, how did finding Cibola prove that Thomas Gates was innocent?","Couldn‚Äôt one assume that he had already solved the cipher, and thus was destroying evidence of his involvement and the clue that could lead to someone else finding it? We see Mitch do something similar later in the film, and if I‚Äôm an outside observer I would assume that Gates was destroying the paper trail. It doesn‚Äôt seem like much of a stretch to believe that Gates solved one clue toward finding the city and failed to complete the puzzle. After all, the Gates family never could finish their treasure hunts until Ben did.

It seems reasonable that finding Cibola established that the diary page was in reference to the city, and not a plot to kill Lincoln. But I think that would still leave Gates on the hook for being accused of aiding the KOGC in their efforts.",movies,1574216529,nationaltreasureq,0,1,True,2019-11-19

I just wanna ask you guys what is the best way to watch the star wars movie ?

 is it there release order the way they came out ?

I just want to intake the best experience upon watching it. I've only watched II, VI when i was i kid together with my dad, and VIII recently. I'm also fond with with movie series like Harry Potter, Divergent, Hunger Games, LOTR, The Hobbit so i might want to add this one.

Thoughts?

Drive (2011),"I really enjoyed this film. It is a love story, in a way, but it is not sappy. While there is a great deal of driving, that is not the movie's main theme. Perhaps it is what drives the lead character. The movie has brutal scenes, but the viewer can understand the cause of the brutality. Ryan Gosling is quietly intense and very believable. The soundtrack really sets the mood as well. Albert Brooks is surprisingly good at being the bad guy. A truly captivating movie.",movies,1574219128,lwmusik,77,1,True,2019-11-19

"Rewatched Denis Villeneuve's film, ""Enemy"" and it was awesome.","Man, such a mind bending film. I remember liking in the past but still not having any idea what it was all about. But now that I am older and had developed my taste for films far more, I came to appreciate a lot more and better understand what is going on. But first, I want to start with the less complicated¬†stuff.

I think the film haves fantastic cinematography. Very atmospheric and beautiful looking but also creating this unsettling feeling throughout the entire film. It haves this compelling dissonance of very detailed and clean visuals that are also contaminated in a subtle yellow pollution. Jake also gives a really great performance in this. The dude is such an amazing actor. And the film is pretty with its tone of making the experience horrific despite not being an horror also psychological, which is quite fitting it is trying to¬†tell.

Next, let's go a little bit on what the film is about. I won't go so much in depth with the plot because first of all, I am very lazy and second, I just want to talk about its possible¬†messages/themes.

Let's just conclude that &gt;!both ""clones"" are the same person (as much as it is hinted in the movie.) The motorcyclist one is meant to represent the darker side of the protagonist. The side of himself that forces to keep being unfaithful on his wife.!&lt;

We get to see to hear a speech from the protagonist about authoritarianism. How there is a government that takes control over our lives and that it is pattern that keeps on repeating in history. This is bluntly shown through the editing in the first scenes of the film where the protagonists keeps on having sex with a woman even though he is married to another¬†one

How does it relate with the rest of the film? Well, I do not think the message of the film is about our government having control over us but rather, our urges having control over us. How we cannot control ourselves and how we keep on repeating the same mistakes throughout our lives. In this case, the protagonist's obsession on having sex with other women. His uncontrollable¬†lust.

And what do the spiders represent? In my opinion, they most clearly represent the main character's lust for other women. This seems to be hinted quite well in the opening scene where it shows like a woman masturbating in front of a bunch of guys and also a spider. Like a sort of sex club. We see that the protagonist also seems disgusted by this but also like he cannot do anything to stop it as it is something having control over his life. Not to mention that we see a naked woman wearing a spider mask walking backwards in a¬†hallway.

We do also get to see the &gt;!darker version of the protagonist die in a car accident, which I interpreted as being more a metaphorical scene rather than something actually happening in the film. For me, it is meant to be the protagonist's fake killing of his darker self.!&lt; That by feeling guilty and having sex with his life, he is somehow deleting his wrongful acts and that he'll be cured from his¬†lust.

We also get a close-up of the cracked glass of the car, which resembles spider web. This is a way of saying that the protagonist is still ""trapped on the spider¬†web.""

We also get the &gt;!bizarre ending of the film with the giant spider. Where it supposedly appears where her wife was, who do not see in the room. I think what it is saying is that his lust ""ate his wife"". Killed his¬†marriage.!&lt;

This is a story about how our perversions can control us and ruin our lives. That no matter how much we think that we can control them, they come back again to us to cause chaos in our personal¬†lives.

I really love this film and it is exactly my kind of movie. I have this strong love for films which are atmospheric and leaves a lot of room for¬†analysis/interpretation.",movies,1574221831,Gattsu2000,0,1,True,2019-11-19

"I'm tired of ""Movie DLC"" that franchises like Star Wars have started up.","I'm not sure if the term ""Movie DLC"" has been coined but I'll go ahead and do it in case it hasn't. Some say that DLC is made as to make the game full, but you need to pay even more money to get the full experience. I think the same goes for movies. Look at the Star Wars prequels for example. It's so stupid that in order to know what's really going on you have to buy countless amounts of extended lore to understand who Snoke is, where the First Order came from, how Maz got Luke's lightsaber, what happened between the events of Ep 6 and 7, etc. It used to be that media outside the film was just a nice way to expand upon the universe in a cheaper format while either explaining barely talked about events, or offering more information for lore junkies. Example being what happens between Attack of the Clones and Revenge of the Sith (mainly the Clone Wars series.) It's an interesting sidecanon that doesn't affect the films at all. However now studios are injecting this sidecanon into the movies to the point where it's forcing average audience members pay money to find out more. Example being putting Darth Maul into Solo. Oh wanna know how he survived and isn't in the original trilogy? Spend money on Disney+ to find out by watching several series in which such useless information doesn't improve the quality of the films. The same goes for the sequel trilogy in which entire events are seemingly glanced over so they can be explained in books that you'd have to go out an buy. 

The MCU is the same way. Want to know how the fuck Captain Marvel is since she appeared in like 5 minutes of End Game? You better go watch the entire movie about her even though her existence in End Game is replaceable.

What films do you find more charming than good?,"Willow fits that description for me perfectly. It's by no means a perfect film, and it is quite dated, but I find everything about it charming. Every performance, especially Warwick Davis as Willow and Val Kilmer as Madmartigan. The battle scenes and fight choreography are charming. The special effects are charming. You can tell that they earnestly tried as best they could to create something on the scale of Lord of the Rings, but were over a decade too early and the technology wasn't there yet. It also shows us what a Hobbit or Lord of the Rings movie would have looked like if it had been made in the 80s. But I'm glad it's not actually Lord of the Rings. I remember there was a commercial in the early 2000s that said something like ""before Lord of the Rings there was Willow"" which got me interested in the movie.

"Diagnoses of the patients in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest""","I recently re-watched One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and it's one of my all time favorites. The acting and writing is phenomenal and the characters are memorable and likable. Even though it's not really important why, but I'm still curious why were each patient there. (I love how the audience is let to have their own opinion what's wrong with them, because that's not the point, only the characters matter, if you catch my point.) So let's discuss. (PS: I haven't read the novel, so I don't know if they explained the characters better in that, so...)

* R. P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) - Not technically psychotic, just highly ""energetic"", so I'd say ADHD (or something like that)
* Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif) - I'd say he's maybe borderline?
* Chief Bromden (Will Sampson) - This is a difficult one, as he's mute for more than half of the film, maybe they thought he had clinical depression.
* Harding (William Redfield) - In the therapy session, they spoke about his relationship to his wife, so maybe paranoid schizophrenia (I could be wrong)
* Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick) - He has these tantrums through out the film, so... (Also  quite difficult, help me out here.)
* Taber (Christopher Lloyd) - He had a very short temper.
* Martini (Danny DeVito) - Always smiling + McMurphy mentioned in the dialogue ""These are REAL people"", so autism + schizophrenia?

"Diagnoses of the patients in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest""","I recently re-watched One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest and it's one of my all time favorites. The acting and writing is phenomenal and the characters are memorable and likable. Even though it's not really important why, but I'm still curious why were each patient there. (I love how the audience is let to have their own opinion what's wrong with them, because that's not the point, only the characters matter, if you catch my point.) So let's discuss. (PS: I haven't read the novel, so I don't know if they explained the characters better in that, so...)

* R. P. McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) - Not technically psychotic, just highly ""energetic"", so I'd say ADHD (or something like that)
* Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif) - I'd say he's maybe borderline?
* Chief Bromden (Will Sampson) - This is a difficult one, as he's mute for more than half of the film, maybe they thought he had clinical depression.
* Harding (William Redfield) - In the therapy session, they spoke about his relationship to his wife who I think had an affair, so maybe paranoid schizophrenia (I could be wrong)
* Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick) - He has these tantrums through out the film, so... (Also quite difficult, help me out here.)
* Taber (Christopher Lloyd) - He had a very short temper.
* Martini (Danny DeVito) - Always smiling + McMurphy mentioned in the dialogue ""These are REAL people"", so autism + schizophrenia?
* Scanlon (Delos V. Smith Jr.) - The quiet bearded man who wanted to be alone, so I'd say depression.
* Sefelt (William Duell) - This is also a difficult one, did they mention him being one of the chronics?
* Ellsworth (Dwight Marfield) - The dancing elderly, who seemed to live in his own fantasy world, so maybe schizophrenia + ????

Longest of long shots here: can ANYONE identify a Chinese romcom I saw on a Delta flight years ago?-hella spoilers ahead!,"This is almost definitely a fucking Sisyphean effort but I once watched the weirdest movie I have ever had the privilege of seeing on a Delta flight to Amsterdam in maybe 2014 or 2016. It was in Chinese, probably produced by a Chinese director. The best way I can describe it is that it was a romcom about a fashion designer whose mother pushed him to marry one of the models within her company. There was a competition between the women to design a dress or something like that in order to impress the guy so he'd marry one of them. The guy doesn't like any of the models and begins to fall for the janitor lady who he meets when he (true fucking story) goes up to the roof of the building to hit a punching bag that's just up there and sees her blowing bubbles on the roof. As the movie progresses they get closer but it is eventually learned that the woman's mother was a major rival of the man's mother. The man's mother stole a dress design from the woman's mother that made her famous and decades later the woman's mother sent her daughter to the company in the guise of a hopeful designer to secude the man and then break his heart. Of course they both end up falling in love and defying their parents but the point is I cannot find this goddamn piece of cinematic mastery anywhere. I could have sworn it's called The Beauty but despite going through the wikipedia database of Chinese movies released in the 2000s and onward I have come up with jack shit. I'm beginning to think I hallucinated the whole thing and it's a divine calling to create this movie.

'Joker' Sequel in the Works as Todd Phillips Eyes More DC Origin Movies (Exclusive),"&gt; On Oct. 7, Joker director Todd Phillips headed into Warner Bros. Pictures Group chairman Toby Emmerich's office, buoyed by the film's $96.2 million opening-weekend haul. Sources tell The Hollywood Reporter he proposed an outsized idea ‚Äî the rights to develop a portfolio of DC characters' origin stories.

&gt;  balked. After all, Warner Bros. is very protective of the DC canon. And all other DC deals have been for one film, and one film only. But Phillips did emerge from the meeting with the rights to at least one other DC story, sources say. And now that Joker has crossed the $1 billion mark, a sequel is on the way. As the movie keeps raking in money overseas, Phillips is in talks to reprise his role as director for a second Joker outing (he and Scott Silver, who penned the gritty Joker screenplay, will write the follow-up), THR has learned.

Meanwhile, the only real advantage I see in film is the budget. And with shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones, which often have a cinematic feel on par with films, that advantage isn't as strong as it once was.",movies,1574272330,ClaudeFrollo1986,10,1,True,2019-11-20

Need help remembering what movie this is - possible made for TV film from the early 2000s,"I remember watching a film on TV when I was around 5-7 years old. Approx around 2002-2004ish?

Probably on lifetime, or TNT, or one of the ""Mom"" channels from those times.

What I remember about the movie was that the main character was a girl, and she was in a large house which I don't think she lived in, but I think she had memories of it from her childhood.

And there were bad guys looking for diamonds (that I think were hidden in the chandelier of the house)

I also remember that she started to fall in love with a guy, they had sex, and he ended up being a bad guy looking for the diamonds too.

I think I remember there being a scene in a cave, which she also had memories of from childhood.

Decisions by Studio Executives,"Does anyone know any examples of actually good decisions made by Studio executives? You know, they guys who often make big decisions for films being made by not so established directors or works that may not appeal to the biggest audiences.

Usually I only hear about how they ruin movies with their meddling. Time and time again they ruin the artists' vision, give them too little time to really get their works how they want, turn it into a sequel of another franchise, decide who is or isn't going to be cast, or even change the whole tone to appeal to a certain audience. 

I'm wondering if there's situations where they actually had good input and made a film more successful than it would have been. Anyone know any situations like that or times where they might've known what they were talking about? Is it possible that they do make a lotta good decisions and and all their bad decisions get blown up? Just wondering.

[Theory] Emperor Palpatine has been seeking the most powerful force user since Episode 1 so they can both achieve more than just a galactic empire,"My theory is that palatine has always been after the most powerful force user because he wants them to rule the galaxy. Now, you‚Äôre probably thinking no shit but I think what I‚Äôm about to say  goes a little deeper.

I think palpatine was planning on him and Anakin going beyond just the empire and ruling the galaxy just the two of them because they‚Äôre so powerful. However since anakin was dismembered he had to abandon his plan and stick with just the empire. But that‚Äôs why he wanted Luke to turn and take Vader‚Äôs place. He knew he and like could go beyond just the empire. Now, what that is, I don‚Äôt know. But I believe Palpatine wanted more than just a galactic empire. 

Now, I think that‚Äôs what episode 9 will be about. He created Rey to be the most powerful force user so they can both achieve is ultimate dream. Yes, he got to rule the galaxy as emperor of the empire, but for him that wasn‚Äôt enough. 

Who knows, but I think that man was after more power. This ain‚Äôt the sky walker saga, it‚Äôs the palpatine saga.",movies,1574280559,Movieguy669,4,1,True,2019-11-20

How the ‚ÄòAvengers: Endgame‚Äô Writers Made Life-and-Death Decisions,"LINK: [https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/avengers-endgame-writers-alternate-storylines](https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2019/11/avengers-endgame-writers-alternate-storylines)  


&gt;Tony Stark was marked for death more than four  years ago. From there, it was just a matter of how to do it. The why had  already been decided.  
&gt;  
&gt;Almost everything else about the Avengers films *Infinity War* and *Endgame*  changed over and over again. Superheroes beating up themselves in a  mirror world. Smart Hulk appearing one movie early. Before this played  out onscreen, it appeared first on a magnetic whiteboard covered in  scrap paper, colored notecards, and one-of-a-kind superhero trading  cards that were marked with ascending dollar sign levels‚Äîto keep salary  costs in mind.  
&gt;  
&gt;That conference room at Marvel Studios was where screenwriters **Christopher Markus** and **Stephen McFeely**  were mapping out the two-part Avengers finale that brought closure to  the multibillion-dollar Marvel Cinematic Universe and became two of the  highest-grossing movies of all time.  
&gt;  
&gt;Their  whiteboard was one of the most closely guarded secrets in the world.  Even the actors didn‚Äôt know all the details during shooting.  
&gt;  
&gt;What fans *still*  don‚Äôt know, even today, are the alternate versions‚Äîthe diversions and  dead ends, the reshoots and the reasoning that went into concluding the  story lines (and sometimes the lives) of some of the most beloved  characters on the planet.

Why does The Dark Knight trilogy feel so disconnected? Each film is like a different genre,"**I'm not saying this is a criticism of the trilogy, I find it interesting...but to an extent, odd...**

Upon re-watching this trilogy, I've noticed that each film in this trilogy feels very distinct and different from one another. Each of the 3 films feels very distinct in tone, colour palette and mood. 

It's almost as if, at times, they don't really feel that connected...almost like they're not in the same continuity. 

Batman Begins is the fantasy comic book film. The Dark Knight is a crime thriller with the blue hue aesthetic. The Dark Knight Rises is a somber epic that has a more black/grey aesthetic. 

Compared to other trilogies, this is quite uncommon. The original Star Wars, Indians Jones and Lord of The Rings trilogies are all great, and they all FEEL connected in terms of aesthetic and tone. This is also the case for other trilogies (e.g. Toy Story, Spider-Man, etc)....all feel aesthetically and narratively same tone.

I need help finding a certain movie,"A couple of years ago I watched a very interesting movie and would live to rewatch it but for the life of me can‚Äôt remember what it was called. 

It‚Äôs about this troubled kid who gets sent to a detention camp/ boot camp with other troubled teens. He gets pulled out of his house in the middle of the night and gets thrown into a van. He then arrives at this camp and every day they have to run down this very long road while followed by a guy on a four wheeler. When they get to the end of the road, the lead runner puts mail into the mailbox while the other guys get water. If you didn‚Äôt get water by the time the lead runner had put the mail in the box, you didn‚Äôt get any. 

It comes out later that the main kid had went to a party where he accidentally gets his best friend or his girlfriends brother killed. That‚Äôs the main reason he got sent to this camp.

After a bit, he escapes and goes to the police but they end up bringing him back because of some thing to do with the camp. He gets strung up in a very dark room and sprayed with a very large amount of water.

Later in the film, one of his old friends shows up at the camp and they sort of reunite. His friend puts sugar in the generals vehicle and causes it to not start. His friend gets strung up and tortured. 

He then helps his friend escape and his friend breaks his neck or something.

That‚Äôs all I remember about the movie. I‚Äôve tried searching and searching but I can‚Äôt figure it out. If you know what it is, I‚Äôd very much appreciate it",movies,1571626009,BananaPenguinSquid,0,1,True,2019-10-20

I rewatch Black Mass once in a while and I gotta say something.,"Starring Joel Edgerton, Johnny Depp, Jesse Plemons, Rory Cochrane, Corey Stoll, Kevin Bacon, Benedict Cumberbatch, Dakota Johnson, Peter Sarsagaard

It's a crime that this movie is underrated. Both Johnny Depp and Tom's score for the movie at least deserved some recognition, from small little details when Depp was scolding his member for being unhygienic in a bar\[peanuts scene\] to stealing the screen in intense moments like confronting the whistleblower in the 3rd act.   


The score, Strictly Criminal where everyone was shown facing the consequences and what actually happened to them is also another strong point for this movie, those violin\[correct me if I'm wrong\] and the high notes in the score really grabs my attention.

One of the better ensemble cast movies out there I think that, I think everyone did a fantastic job but Dakota Johnson felt odd playing that role. Didn't expect Kevin Bacon to be in the movie.

Sad that this movie didn't get the attention it deserved but at least there were some profits, modest budget around $50m without marketing and got back almost a $100mil considering it being an R Rated Crime film released during a busy period with other films.",movies,1571626714,NotYourMovieBuff,21,21,True,2019-10-20

what exactly is the current plot of terminator?,"firstly i will say that i am not 40 years old yet, so i didn't watch terminator 1 and the tv show because it wasn't showed here.

but i did watch terminator 2 and a few other movies.

so since the new terminator is coming out soon, i was wondering what exactly is the franchise at right now because i have no idea what's going on in the terminator universe.

i believe that in terminator 1, kyle was sent back to protect john's mother, sarah from the arnold terminator who was sent to kill sarah.

later on, it was revealed that kyle is john's father cus he banged sarah during the short time he had protecting her.

fast forward several years, we have terminator 2 where the most badass and cool terminator was sent back to kill john this time.

now we have sarah and the arnold terminator sent back in time to protect john. but they also want to do their best to change the timeline to prevent the terminators from ever created by stealing and destroying the remains of the Arnold terminator from terminator 1.

then we have 3, which i dont remember anything, salvation and genesys which i also don't remember anything from. i think theres also a tv show that should take place inbetween 2 and 3?

i watched one of the terminator movies (dont remember which one) which revealed that john actually died, but his death was concealed and they pretended that he was alive to give the rebels hope. then i think kyle? was also revealed to be a terminator?

i think it was also revealed in that movie that there was little hope of actually winning the robots or something along those lines",movies,1571657834,tidesss,16,0,True,2019-10-21

"So I just watched 'The Dead Don't Die.' Disappointed. Not angry, just let down.","There were things to like about the movie.  The pacing that the director uses, as is typical of his style, is laconic and slow but it isn't lazy- the story moves along faster than you think, if that makes any sense.  The cast is a big highlight, but also a point of frustration.  Adam Driver, Bill Murray, Danny Glover, Steve Buscemi, Chloe Sevigny, Tom Waites, and Tilda Swinton i(n her most self-aware form here, embracing her public perception of all-out weirdness).  So yeah, there they are but, at the same time, the script sees to it that they're done no justice.  The main cast is barely more developed than the cameos strewn throughout the film, like Rosie Perez, Carol Kane and Iggy Pop.  And Selena Gomez... not a main cast role, not a cameo, but just enough to see that she's stiff as a board and not a very good actor, like, at all.  The most developed character in the film was Sevigny (I did not realize she's in her mid-forties), who initially was shown to display prickliness but we later find that it's to hide that she doesn't have the emotional disposition to be an effective cop, she's wayyyy too thin-skinned for the job.

&amp;#x200B;

Anyhoo.  Breaking the fourth wall was groan-inducing, what with the dialogue in the film actually discussing the script, discussing improvising in a scene, and the mentioning of Sturgill Simpson (also another cameo in the film) every eleven minutes.

But the inverse is also good, like how Leslie Nelson was actually in serious roles before he became known for those comedic movies.

How graphic/scary/disturbing is Mother! (2017) ?,"This film came on Netflix in the UK semi-recently and I've had my eye on it since it released but never took the plunge. This is kind of embarrassing, but I'm a real wuss when it comes to horror, and anything involving things like bodily mutilation, creepy cult stuff, realistic gore, that kind of thing. I can deal with gore in an action movie or something (and even enjoy it, like Logan, Predator, Dredd) but in a certain context it can be a bit much for me and it makes me sick. If all that I just said reminded you of Midsommar, you'd be right - I went to see that film and I had to walk out after the cliff jump scene because I couldn't handle it and I was on the verge of passing out. I know, what a loser. I'm fine with campy horror and stuff that is more psychological, I loved Get Out for instance although I guess it's up for debate whether it's really a 'true' horror. 

I haven't really looked up anything about Mother! other than the basic premise because I hear it's one of those where it's best to go in completely blind so I would like to preserve that if possible, but from what I have heard it does sound like one of 'those' kind of movies, if you get me. So, if you can without spoiling too much (I understand you'll have to give a little bit of it away), what level of fucked up are we talking here?",movies,1571669313,greg225,17,4,True,2019-10-21

(500) Days of Summer - 2009,"*500 Days of Summer tells the story Tom played by Joseph Gordon Levitt who believes in a true love and the idea that it can exist, he falls for Summer played by Zooey Deschanel who does not believe in love, she is not against the idea of relationships but does like to keep boundaries and knows in her mind what she wants and needs. As a result we see the telling of a relationship that is ever going to go the way either want as they both want something different.*

I cannot remember when I how I saw this film. It is possible that I saw it in a guide and thought it had an interesting title (and I still love that title) or that it was recommended to me by Amazon but either way I fell in love and am still in love with this film. I think for many the idea of Romantic Films is an in built happy story is a must and if it does not have this it is a failing but I really don't believe this is the case. Love is raw, emotional, nice and sometimes sickening. Love can make you wake up in the morning and want to sing where as it can also make you never want to wake up at all.

You could say this film is somewhat depressing but I don't think it is, I think it is just very real. I had never known this was based on a book called ""Course Of Love"" but reading this book I also find it to be such a good read.

I don't really have much  more to say right now, I think watching Modern Love on Amazon has brought this film back into my mind again. It will be on my watch list for this week.",movies,1571670325,endangeredpenguin,10,0,True,2019-10-21

"Modern cinema and ""subverted expectations""","This is more a bit of a rant about my own personal frustrations with modern film, particularly horror. 

Many films that I watch today are all about twists. They're about making you think one thing while having the outcome be not nearly as obvious. This is honestly a lot of fun. I think it helps to keep the audience involved and once revealed, can also make the audience actually think about the film they have just watched because they're searching for hidden clues. 

My issue with it in modern cinema is the fact that these ""twists"" are completely nonsensical. They exist purely to subvert expectations. There is no build up. There are no clues. They just spend a movie telling you something only to completely turn it on it's head in the last 20 minutes. This is fucking stupid. 

It's part of the reason the final season of Game of Thrones did so poorly. Characters began doing things out of character and things began happening that completely negated 7 seasons of build up. The only difference between what happened there and what is happening in cinema is the writers were extremely obtuse about it in GoT. We also had several years of build up with that series compared to 90 minutes in a film. 

Don't get me wrong. Twists in film are a great strategy. But they cannot be random. There has to be a reason for the twist and for the most part that reasoning should be slightly evident throughout the entirety of the film. But nowadays the reasoning comes as the twist happens. The audience is left scratching their heads and no amount of searching can make them realize, ""oh if I had paid closer attention I could've seen this coming"". 

Take the new movie ELI on Netflix for example. SPOILERS FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN:


The movie is about a young child who has a disease that makes it so he cannot go outside. In the film he goes to a special treatment facility in order to help find a cure for him. Throughout the film we learn this facility is a little more ominous than it first seemed and we are left to wonder if the doctor is actually hurting him rather than helping him. Are you ready for the twist? His mom made a deal with the Devil and he is the spawn of satan and the facility has been injecting him with holy water in order to help rid him of his evil nature. 

WHAT THE FUCK?! Where in the world did that come from? The only ""clues"" we recieved throughout the film was mention the family had religious ties. 

Your story needs to not only make sense but also mean something. Your audience shouldn't feel like their time has been wasted, and that can very easily happen when you have 90 minutes of story telling mean nothing because you wanted to throw in an unexpected twist. 

Just because I did not accurately predict the end of the film, it does not automatically become good. But unfortunately, that seems to be the way cinema is going. People will remember the end of the movie most clearly, and if you make that end subvert expectations, that fact becomes very prominent in the audience's mind. Suddenly the rest of the movie doesn't matter as much. 

This is not how the future of film should behave. Please, stop with the nonsensical twists that don't actually mean anything. Keeping the audience guessing is very different from throwing in randomness.",movies,1571680634,BentheBruiser,5,0,True,2019-10-21

Please help me find the name of this old animated film.,I watched this movie awhile ago.  I remember it was long (like 2.5 hours) and if I were to guess I would say it was released sometime between 1970 -1979.   I guess you could call it science fiction because it was about an enlightened humanity after they abandoned all of there destructive technology.  They were still educated but everything they did was organic or grown.  They flew around on giant flying creatures.  They had access to all of there history. This giant brain tries to take over the world.  The brain came from some old human experiment that has now grown into a monster that now lives in the ocean.

Cold War(2018)- Mirror Shot,"I was recently watching Cold War, and the mirror shot is such an innovative and awesome shot. Basically, the characters are at a party they don't want to be at and they are leaning against a large mirror, in which the rest of the party is being reflected. This represents the almost physical distance that the characters feel from the rest of the partygoers, as if they are in a ""different world"" from the party entirely. The black and white cinematography makes the shot even look better because it sort of obscures the mirror.

Lady Bird is the most overrated movie in the past 3 years and does not deserve the praise it receives.,"Title.

**intro**
I finally got around to watching Lady Bird after hearing how incredible the movie is, seeing 99% from Rotten Tomatoes and 94% from Metacritic, and  reading a lot of reviews stating how relatable and powerful Lady Bird's character is. So I finally decided to mark it off my **A24** list. 

I expected Lady Bird to be one of the best coming-of-age films I've seen (one of the best films in general with those reviews), filled with laughs, growth and hardship. 

Instead, I found myself watching a cliche, average day of a middle-class white girl? I was bored, confused, and completely disinterested. Is this high-brow art that I dont understand?

**Discusion**  

*Lady Bird*  - *Christine*

The entire movie revolves around this character. It's obvious that the film wants you to like Lady Bird, but how could anyone like Lady Bird? The film fails big-time is this regard. Who relates to Lady Bird? She's just a bitch. 

Lady Bird has almost zero redeeming qualities. Lady Bird is an annoying brat. The **problem** with that is the movie tries to convey her, as just a young girl growing up, solving problems her way. She's strong and quirky. But she doesn't come across that way. 



She screws over her best friend.

Seemingly gets whatever guy she pursues. 



Christine has a decent house. 

She goes to a great school.

She has two loving parents. 

She has a great best friend.

She's attracive

I expected Lady Bird to be a riveting coming-of-age film (one of the best films in general with those reviews), filled with laughs, growth and hardship. 

Instead, I found myself watching a clich√©, average day of a bratty middle-class white girl? I was bored, confused, and completely disinterested. Is this highbrow art that I don‚Äôt understand?

**Discussion**  

*Lady Bird*  - *Christine*

The entire movie revolves around Lady Bird. Lady Bird is a high school senior that is portrayed as a quirky, strong girl with a lot of *struggles* and *hurdles* to overcome.  The issue is that these problems aren‚Äôt really problems: 

Sharing a bathroom

Not having the best sex

Being attractive but not as attractive as she‚Äôd like

Thinking she might not get to go to her perfect college, which she ends up doing anyways

Her perfect college experience being not perfect 

Arguing with her mom 

Not being as rich as the richest kids in school 

Wahh, poor Lady Bird. These aren‚Äôt struggles.  These are one-line jokes that the movie tries to portray as struggles. This distances me from Lady Bird. Why would I care about some average girl living some average life? 

But okay. Lets brush that aside, and pretend I did care about that.  That‚Äôs the movie I want to see. I want to see some average middle-class white girl do normal things. 

Lady Bird is just a *bitch*

 She treats her mom like shit, which the movie tries to disguise as a young girl just arguing with her mom.

 She treats her best friend like shit, which the movie tries to disguise as a young girl just unsure of her friend group.

 She treats her teachers like shit, which the movie tries to disguise as a young girl being quirky. 

She treats her dad like shit, which the movie tries to disguise as a young girl embarrassed by her parents.   

These two points combine to create the *biggest* failure of the movie,  *even though Lady Bird is a lazy bitch, she still succeeds!*

She drops her best friend and her best friend comes back to her. She‚Äôs endlessly rude to her parents and of course they always love her. She literally tries to be hurtful to the nuns at her school and it fails because they laugh her off. She doesn‚Äôt apply herself in school and still manages to get into her dream school. She jumps out of a moving vehicle and only manages a broken wrist. She dyes her hair pink and seemingly doesn‚Äôt take care of herself, shown by her greasy look and chipped nail polish, but still gets the guys she pursues. And she forces people to call her a dumbass name like Lady Bird. 

There are no consequences to her actions. Who the hell can relate to this? Lady Bird has more plot armor than Batman. 

There‚Äôs even a scene at the end where Lady Bird gets alcohol poisoning and has to go to the ER. I think, finally, a scene where Lady Bird cannot escape this unscathed. A scene where the hospital bill will be expensive, or she might get arrested, or maybe she will have embarrassed herself to the point of no return or maybe, at least her clothes will be ruined? Fuck no. She walks out of the hospital no worse for wear. There are just no consequences to this bitches actions. 

There‚Äôs another scene where Lady Bird is trying on prom dresses and says, ‚ÄúI wish I looked like the girls in the magazines.‚Äù ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶like what? Tall, skinny, and attractive? You do look like the ‚Äúgirls in the magazines.‚Äù Another failed attempt to create a relatable character.

Lastly, there‚Äôs a scene with Lady Bird at a party where she comments on someone not believing in God. Paraphrasing - ‚ÄúPeople call themselves the name their parents come up for them but don‚Äôt believe in God.‚Äù What? What is this supposed to even mean? How is a belief or disbelief in God the same as accepting your birth name? I think this is supposed to be a profound statement by Lady Bird, but it makes her seem like r/im15andthisisdeep.

In *conclusion,* Lady Bird is supposed to be a strong quirky teenager, tackling life her way ‚Äì dealing with the trials and tribulations that all teenagers experience. Except‚Ä¶. she doesn‚Äôt. Lady Bird doesn‚Äôt really have many problems and she managers to skirt through life pretty easily.

*TLDR Lady Bird is a bitch, has little consequences to her actions and manages to succeed anyway. No, I don‚Äôt relate to this character She sucks. *",movies,1571684233,TylertheDouche,128,0,True,2019-10-21

In each one of em‚Äô where should i stop so i can get the best experience without the horrible sequels ruining the lore and wasting my time? I want to leave the franchises on a good note. 
I‚Äôve also noticed there are remakes and reboots in the series‚Äôs, should i watch some of them? Please take everything into consideration.

Is it harder to start as a director in 2019 compared to like 20 years ago?,"I read loads of stories of how directors back then became big

1. They make a low budget short film and win awards for it

2. A studio notices them and gives them funding to make their own movie to put in theatres

3.¬† The movie is made, put in theatres and is a box office hit

Today though it seems like the 2nd and 3rd one is taken out of the equation and the vast majoirty of directors need to secure their own funding now with their own money or try to gather as much money online as possible, and alot of the movies made dont even see a limited theatrical release and are instead put on netflix where they are soon forgotten

Investors dont seem to be interested in small movies anymore except big blockbuster ones 

How are you supposed to move up on in the film world as a director these days exactly?

It seems the majoirity of directors around today were also around 10 to 15 years ago already having a carreer built up",movies,1571693896,holothewisewolf12345,14,5,True,2019-10-21
"As the decade is slowly closing out, what are your 10 favorite movies of the past 10 years?","Now, this is obviously a very vague question and the range of the movies will be very wide, but I'd be interested in knowing what your favorite movies of the decade are. 

For example, mine are:

1. The Master (2012, Paul Thomas Anderson)
2. Silence (2016, Martin Scorsese)
3. Blade Runner 2049 (2017, Denis Villeneuve)
4. Mad Max: Fury Road (2015, George Miller)
5. Parasite (2019, Bong Joon-Ho)
6. Skyfall (2012, Sam Mendes)
7. Hell or High Water (2016, David Mackenzie)
8. Roma (2018, Alfonso Cuaron)
9. Macbeth (2015, Justin Kurzel)
10. Grand Budapest Hotel (2014, Wes Anderson)

&amp;#x200B;

Of course, a whole decade is way too much to be only summed up in a top 10, but I think my top 10 is quite fitting for me. Some other notable picks would be, definitely:

The Killing of a Sacred Deer (2017, Yorgos Lanthimos), The Hunt (2012, Thomas Vinterberg), Arrival (2016, Denis Villeneuve),  Sicario (2015, Denis Villeneuve), Hereditary (2018, Ari Aster), Inception (2010, Christopher Nolan), El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie (2019, Vince Gilligan), Shutter Island (2010, Martin Scorsese), The Wolf of Wall Street (2013, Martin Scorsese)

There are plenty of other great movies I have enjoyed and think are some of the most re-watchable of the decade such as The Avengers, MI: Fallout, Edge of Tomorrow, The Worlds End and so on and there are also a lot of ""great"" movies I haven't seen yet, mainly The Irishman, or The Lighthouse, or Manchester by the Sea, or The Handmaiden, or The Tree of Life, or The Favorite, which all could end up in my list.

Spoiler question about The Joker inside.,"I went to the theater with a friend of mine to see The Joker. And we were wondering why his shoulder blade was jutting out the way it was.

My friend thought it was because of the beating he received. But I thought it was because his mom used to shackle him to the radiator for extended periods, as explained in the mental hospital papers. Causing The Joker to grown crooked.

I mean, if you receive a beating and your shoulder blade juts out like that it's got to raise some eyebrows but his coworkers never mention it when they see it. And The Joker never seems bothered and neither does he show any constriction in his movement throughout the rest of the movie. So it has to be a normal thing for him and his coworkers. 

But the follow up on this fact is that if the neglect/crazy mom side of the paperwork was legit. Does that also mean the adoption papers are legit?

Or is his moms insanity the very reason why Wayne defrauded the adoption papers? Because why does she have Wayne's declaration of love on the backside of their photograph? Their love and the pregnancy might be real. So the Joker is Wayne's bastard but Wayne broke off the relationship when he found out his servant girl was pregnant causing her to spiral into insanity. Then Wayne defrauded/plants the adoption papers to protect his reputation and trust fund money. 

Personally I think this is the true version. Because why would official adoption papers be kept in the files of an insane asylum? Also why does this asylum keep records for thirty years? It must be because The Waynes' wanted them to be found if they needed it because even the clerk was surprised he found files as old as these.

When it‚Äôs time for McBride Jnr to leave, he‚Äôs literally carrying the baggage of his father. The struggle at the end symbolizes his choice to let go of his past and move on or to burn out like his dad did.

"AD ASTRA: If you think The Thin Red Line is a perfect war film, this is the SF Film for you. Otherwise, no.","I often have the opportunity to see movies for free-- so I've seen many, many films; and many of them are barely passable.

*As Astra* is one of the few I walked out before the end of a movie, because it was too banal to continue. (*Godzilla: King of Monsters* was another such.)

There's a reason that the critics are coming out for it: it's pretentious, but looks beautiful. The problem isn't that it's too cerebral; it's that it has the veneer of intelligence, while parrotting ideas from better productions. 

James Gray desperately wants to be Stanley Kubrick, and have a range of serious films under his belt. Unfortunately, this isn't *2001: A Space Odyssey*. Nor is it *Apocalypse Now*, which it cribs the plot from.

It's also trying to be like Terrence Mallick's 1998 film *The Thin Red Line*, which was 90%  Jim Caviezel floating around doing nothing, while having quietly narrated introspection that we're to take as emotional reflection. Like that movie, 10% of *Ad Astra* is masterfully done action sequences.

But the rest? Not so much.

One of the utter failings of storytelling is forgetting the maxim ""show, not tell."" A movie that has to throw an explanation of its title (Latin for ""To the Stars"") as an opening text should be worrisome.

The dialog in Ad Astra terrible, unnaturally stilted, and exists solely for exposition, to lay out the backstory in the most boring and nonsensical way possible. For example, this exciting moment:

    INT.-- DIMLY LIT MEETING ROOM, MORNING
    
    BRAD PITT, a perfect astronaut, with perfect hair, wearing a throwback Army Greens
    uniform with a huge United States Space Command patch on the shoulder, enters an
    unnecessarily mood-lit conference room. Two white guys, and a non-speaking token black
    woman, also in Space Command Uniforms sit at the end of a huge conference table, that has
    like 50 chairs. Two other people just in button down shirts also sit around, writing
    things on pieces of paper, even though this is supposed to be the future. 
    
             GENERIC MILITARY GUY #1
    Is it true that your resting heart rate never goes above 80, even when you're about to
    die, and we should think you're totally cool under pressure? 
    
             BRAD PITT 
    Yes, this is true, because I am awesome.
    
             GENERIC MILITARY GUY #2
    What can you tell us about the LIMA project, which you would obviously know a lot about
    since it was famous and personally connected to you, but the audience doesn't know that?
    
              BRAD PITT
    It was the first deep space project from twenty-six years ago, so I have to explain that
    it is important, because it sets up this movie. Also, this is the future.
    
             GENERIC MILITARY GUY #2
    And the head of the project?
    
             BRAD PITT
    My father. Who coincidentally, was also a famous space cowboy.
    
    The token woman pulls out three big photos of TOMMY LEE JONES in a space suit and puts
    them in front of BRAD PITT.
    
             BRAD PITT
    Yes, this is my famous astronaut father. Thank you for showing me these three printed
    photos, because I had forgotten what he looked like, since he disappeared 26-years ago,
    and I am totally not 55. Later, I will look at his picture on the NASA Hall of Fame so I
    can remember that he was famous, and an astronaut.
    
             GENERIC MILITARY GUY #1
    What if I told you that your father is alive?
    
             BRAD PITT
    That would be surprising, because I thought he was dead, since we haven't heard from him
    for twenty-six years.
    
             GENERIC MILITARY GUY #2
    Well, he's alive, and he's going to destroy the earth. So are you cool to go to Mars to
    send him a message and ask him not to, because although it's 2050, we don't have the
    technology to record you here and transmit it ourselves?

Crazy Rich Asians is pretty much an average movie which got brownie points for casting asians. Yesterday cast an Asian in its lead role and never once made a fuss about his race. No race angle was taken, he was really one of the first South Asian actors to be the lead star of a film without any attention brought to his race.

"What Are Scenes You Personally Think Aren't Talked About Enough In Movies With Scenes That Are Considered More ""Iconic""?","What I am talking about is to mention scenes in movies with other scenes considered more iconic in popular culture that you think should be mentioned more rather than dismissing them. Scenes you think are great and possibly even on pair with those iconic scenes.

For example, ""Carrie"" (1976) is mostly known for the prom massacre scene of ""Carrie"" and the ending. However, these aren't even my favorite scenes from the movie. Personally, I think the scenes that really show the heart of ""Carrie"" are both thes scene where Carrie gets invited to prom and talks about it with teacher: https://youtu.be/3XWCI2B6Nlg and the prom dance scene in ""Carrie"": https://youtu.be/KaaLNjD8L8s

Both of these scenes are very endearing and it's nice for Carrie to finally gain empathy and be seen as a human being who needs support rather than as a freak that is alienater from them and could never coexist. The music is pretty nice in both scenes with some nice acting, especially from Sissy Spacek, who immediately became one of my favorite actresses in film. I also love the cinematography in the dance scene. Some people might find it dizzying for the camera spinning and the very bright lights but I think that is the point. It's a way of making you uncomfortable just like Carrie and also blindening for how intense is this for her. This is the first time Carrie ever had this experience with anyone and it feels very strong for her to take in. She veru often felt rejection and hate but now she is finally gaining acceptance. It also really adds to the tragedy that will happen later in the movie. Without these scenes, this movie wouldn't be as special.

"In Forgetting Sarah Marshall, what the hell kind of tech did Bill Hader‚Äôs character have to make his video chat background change (WITHOUT a green screen)?","To refresh: In-movie, his character communicated via video chat to Jason Segal‚Äôs character. When doing so, he was situated in front of his normal living room. He presses a button and immediately the background changes to a beach. In real life, from behind the scenes footage, he actually is in front of a green screen, but in the movie, the living room background is presumed to be ‚Äúreal‚Äù.

As far as I know, a green screen would have been the only method for him to change the background. Even today with Snapchat, you can‚Äôt do that with video chat.

So what the fuck was his in-universe 2008 technology to make this happen? Unless the character himself had a fake living room background on a green screen, specifically for having fun during video chats.",movies,1569071078,cuatrodemayo,18,0,True,2019-09-21
Looking for the name of a movie:,"I‚Äôve searched so many different variations but here‚Äôs the synopsis: female living in a house, going about her day but isn‚Äôt allowed in the attic. There‚Äôs something evil up there. I believe there‚Äôs some strange occurrences throughout the movie until she walks into a room and starts talking to (what she thinks is) a spirit. The spirit tells her she‚Äôs a psychic medium and every time the girl leaves the room, she forgets that they talked. Turns out, the girl is the actual spirit and (I believe) the evil thing in the attic is really where she (May have) committed suicide / died. While she begins to move on, she sees herself around the house doing her daily activities.

I had originally thought it was ‚ÄúI am the pretty thing that lives in the house‚Äù but it‚Äôs not.

Spider-man far from home and it's leaps of logic,"So I've finally seen the new spider-man movie. I enjoyed the movie, but there were problems that annoyed me a lot that I haven't seen mentioned elsewhere. What bothered me is like the title says immense leaps of logic this movie has to make for the story to work. Before I list of those leaps I would like to say that movies being ""not realistic"" doesn't bother me. As long as the movie follows the internal logic of the universe it's set up in.

The illogical nonsense that bothered me:

- Tony gives Peter one of if not the most powerful weapon on earth without enough safety features. Or they have them, but then ignore them when necessary (eye recognition which knows Peter, but not an ex-stark employe that by Starks own words is ""mentally unstable"").
*Why that's a problem: it goes against Tonys character. He is a brilliant man that was also very worried about worlds safety. He wouldn't let this kinda powerful weapon/tool to just be used by anybody*

- The glasses too easily almost kill an innocent person. Peter should have ether gotten some kinda instructions on what do certain commands mean or the AI should explain it's intent fully. Just saying if someone is a target is nowhere near descriptive enough for a kill command. *Why that's a problem: I know that a lot of people while says that I should just suspend my disbelief since it's only for a comedic scene, but I feel that this is important. Firstly it goes again against Tonys character. Secondly, this plot point is used to frame Peter as irresponsible even tho it was not really his fault*

- Making the illusions come from technology and not magic creates so many logical problems. *Why that's a problem: I can absolutely except that this kinda technology exists, but the problem is that it takes you (or me in this case) out of the otherwise great scenes with illusions and Peter. It doesn't make sense that holograms knew what kind of suit Peter had when he started out. Or the fact that they still somehow physically interacted with him (the snowglobe scene). Making Mysterio use magic would fix this problem and many smaller ones (also for a bonus would remove that bad scene where the backstory of the villain(s) is explained with unnatural dialogue)*

I would like to hear your thoughts on this.",movies,1569073217,z3onn,19,0,True,2019-09-21

Tallahassee and Little Rock are both going to die in Zombieland 2,"     At the end of the movie, when Little Rock and Wichita are stuck at the top of  rollercoaster, the movie purposefully shows the number of zombies they killed, which they haven‚Äôt done the entire movie up until that point. How many did they kill? 7. Rule #7? Travel light. The first reference Ohio makes to that rule is when he is alluding to the fact that he needs to travel alone to survive.

     Tallahassee is going to die from getting thrown out of a window while not wearing his seatbelt, probably sometime early in the movie after he saves the day by kicking some zombie ass (since that‚Äôs what his momma said he was good at, after all). This is because he always writes the number 3 on all of his vehicles. Rule #3? Buckle up.

     Little Rock‚Äôs death is foreshadowed by the first scene we meet her. She and Whichita trick Ohio and Tallahassee into believing she got bit. When they get to Pacific Playland (which is supposed to be empty of zombies), the zombies attack the Yellow Hummer. And although Wichita doesn‚Äôt get bit, Little Rock did. 

     Sometime in the movie, probably early on, we are going to learn that Little Rock is going to become a zombie. The plot of the movie will probably be to find her a cure, but they aren‚Äôt going to be able to, and Wichita is going to have to kill her. Just as she promised.

     If anyone noticed anything else that foreshadows this then please share. I‚Äôm sure I didn‚Äôt catch everything.",movies,1569077052,IDontDerp,2,0,True,2019-09-21
"People who dislike the current reboot/remake trend, where do you draw the line for originality?","I'm genuinely curious about other people's definition of ""original content"" when it comes to film. There recently have been dozens of sequels/remakes/reboots or even new stories that are set in an existing universe. A lot of people complain about unoriginality but without explaining their reasoning.

Is a shot-for-shot remake of a movie, such as Psycho (1998), an original product? I think that most people would say no.

But Hitchcock's Psycho was adapted from a book. Is retelling a story in a different medium enough to be considered original?

Or maybe, for a remake to be seen as legitimate, it has to be different enough, or just better, than the original. It can be that the original film is so old (or so bad) that people forget it exists, so they don't even see the new version as a remake.

The end of Horrible Bosses (when Charlie Day gets revenge on Jennifer Aniston), I swear to god, got a standing ovation from the audience I watched it with. A freaking standing ovation!

Also, I forget what movie I saw this in, but I remember people laughing when M. Night Shyamalan's name come up in the trailer for Devil. It was funny to see people laugh at what was supposed to be a serious trailer.

Cineplex Website is a Travesty,"This should narrowly fall into the proper rules for r/movies...  


Along with all the heinous changes Cineplex has performed over the years in a desperate attempt to remain profitable for their shareholders - the website has taken a massive hit.   


Once upon a time, (10+ years ago), even before Google had mastered their own algorithms - I could google a movie title, and the Cineplex location - and be provided movie times. One search. Eventually those times didn't get updated, and the website became the defacto choice. Was still easy - Cineplex, movie theatre, movie title - and the times are displayed.  


NOW, its giant pages of text and ads of slow loading information, and requires you to click though and select categories for each movie, then the theatre, and hope it loads/finds the theatre. AND hope that the times are accurate. If you back out of that page, it resets all criteria, and you have to enter it all in for the NEXT movie search.  


It used to be one page. Easily available, easily accessed, mostly accurate information. Done. Easy.   


I imagine they've done this to forced everyone into downloading their app, which of course provides data to them. But I shouldn't have to. They had a working, logical system. Now it's painstaking to find a fucking movie time for ONE movie at ONE theatre.

Should I Watch Ad Astra?,"Ever since I saw the trailer, I was excited for *Ad Astra* to come out in theaters. The rover chase on the moon looked spectacular, and I also liked the worldbuilding. When the critic's score came out (82% on RT) my excitement grew. A lot of people on Reddit were excited for this movie too, and I thought the audience score might even exceed the critic's score. 

Then I found out that the audience score was 51%. 

Lots of people called *Ad Astra* ""slow-paced."" As a fan of *Interstellar*, I'm fine with longer movies that have a slower pace (if the story is good). And with Ad Astra having a way shorter run-time than Interstellar, I doubt it's insanely slow-paced. Plus, the trailers made *Ad Astra* look like it had enough action to keep the audience entertained. 

Anyways, I've been very busy as of late and am wondering if I should take the time and watch it.

How to make The Dark Knight better,"1. Get rid of the PG rating.

1.1 Show the life and death fight the three men are forced to do. That'll perfectly picture how chaos instantly turns people on each other and the jokers power over them. It also gives a bit of subtle context to his other goons who otherwise just randomly show up throughout the movie

1.2. Show the shotgun headshot on the truck driver. That'll change the scene from ""okay, that's how he got the truck"" to ""holy shit, he's absolutely insane, what just happened"". There's no good reason to forcefully sanitize the mayhem he's causing

1.3. Make the burned two face practical. Nothing much to elaborate. Cgi sucks.

1.4. Let the police fail to evacuate the hospital in time. That'll let you feel the pressure of the joker so much more. Again, it feels sanitized for the sake of the rating. ""Listen kids, the joker won again, he's got Dent, he blew up a hospital but don't worry too much, no one died here""

2. Get rid of the shot of the two kids in the car playing gun or whatever. Like, come on. This is ridiculous. I really don't need to explain this further

3. Now, this is bullshit. The boat scene. Yeah. No one in their right mind can tell me that this makes any sense. You know the majority of both parties would rush to that button and smash it like a tinder date. That's the most artificially pseudo optimistic studio/production company forced on thing I've ever seen in a movie and costs the climax a whole lot of believability.

My Mario movie plot idea,"Illumination is creating their own animated Mario movie and some people might be worried but I have a story idea that can make it really good.



The movie begins in Mii city. Mario and his brother Luigi are two nobody zookeepers in charge of guarding an ape named Donkey Kong. They are orphans having never known their parents and living in foster homes and had training in acrobatics and martial arts from one of their guardians. When they forget to lock the cage Donkey Kong escapes, kidnaps a wealthy woman named Pauline and takes her to the top of a construction site. Mario gets there and eventually saves her but she is mad at them for causing him to get out in the first place. Donkey Kong is shipped on a boat taking him back to the wilderness and Mario and Luigi are fired. Their boss tells Mario he will never amount to anything and will be forgotten after he dies. 

In need of a job to pay their bills and apartment rent the brothers get a job as plumbers. They are eventually given an important assignment to fix a pipe in the sewers near the border to the Mushroom Kingdom which is a country populated by the Toads and nobody else is allowed in. While in the sewers Mario tells Luigi of his dream of doing something great but Luigi doubts him. They are fixing the pipe when suddenly they are attacked by a group of turtle like creatures. The brothers fight the creatures with their hammers but find themselves overrun until they find a block with the word POW on it which Mario throws at the ground and knocks all of them out. The brothers see more of them coming and escape through a green pipe.

The brothers climb through the pipe and get out and discover that they are in the mushroom kingdom. They are apprehended by a group of Toads armed with spears and taken to the castle. There they meet Princess Peach the ruler of the kingdom. She explains that outsiders are not allowed because they are in a dangerous civil war with the Koopa army led by their king Bowser who has also turned a group called the goombas to his side. She tells them that they can stay in the castle for the night but will have to leave in the morning to which they agree. 

Later that evening a fleet of airships arrive at the castle as the town takes heavy damage from cannon fire. Bowser and his forces enter the castle. Mario and Luigi fight off a number of his minions but Peach is apprehended and Bowser has his Right hand, Kamek who is a master of magic unleash a spell on the kingdom that turns all the Toads into simple mushrooms. Peach (Who is the only one with the power to break the spell) is taken to an airship and they fly away to the other side of the kingdom which is Bowsers realm.

Mario and Luigi are unaffected due to them being human and realize what has happened. Luigi suggests they head home but Mario, wanting to prove himself of something great decides that it‚Äôs up to them to save the princess. Luigi, while hesitant agrees to stay by his brothers side and go on the quest with him.

They go on a long travel on foot across the kingdom  and after coming across a mountain blocking their path must enter a pipe to enter a cave and get across. While in there they find a mysterious elderly Toad who is somehow unaffected by the spell due. They tell him of their journey and he says that Mario is very brave but one day he will regret it. Mario asks what he means and the old man simply says ‚ÄúI was there at the beginning and I will be there at the end‚Äù the brothers say goodbye and leave through another pipe. Once they get out they are ambushed by a group of Bowsers minions and are unable to fight them all. They suddenly find an orange flower in the ground however and after accidentally touching it fire begins shooting out of their hands. They use their new power to defeat the minions. After messing around with the fire a little bit the bros decide this will benefit them on their quest and continue their journey to the other side of the kingdom.

They walk and jump through many areas such as deserts, a jungle, a snow valley and mountains over the next few days and one evening after a close call with a large group of minions Luigi decides to bail on the quest due to being very scared of reaching the castle. After an argument Mario says he will be the hero himself and Luigi says Mario is gonna get himself killed and there won‚Äôt be anything he can do but he does not listen and the two brothers part ways. Mario enters Bowsers realm which a pure valley of fire and lava. He approaches Bowsers castle and sneaks through a large group of minions. After getting inside  Mario is spotted and fights his way through the castle. He approaches the throne room (which is abovea long pit leading into lava) where Bowser is waiting for him and Peach is trapped in a prison. Bowser is shocked that somebody so small can battle an army so big. He tells Mario that after he kills him he will tell stories of his bravery but Mario attacks. They fight and Mario finds that his fire power has no effect on Bowser and discovers why when Bowser shoots fire out of his mouth. He uses his hammer to fight and almost wins until Kamek uses a spell to make him larger and escapes. They continue fighting but Mario is overwhelmed and is beaten up. As Bowser is close to finishing him off Luigi shows up. He attack Bowser and tells Mario he never should have left. Mario stands up and tells Luigi he the hero. They work together to defeat bowser in a final duel. Eventually they defeat him and he reverts back to normal size. They then use their hammers to knock him back and he begs for forgiveness but they knock him off and he falls down the long pit. 

The brothers free Peach from the prison and she expresses her gratitude, calling them both true heroes. They take her back to her castle where she uses a spell from a book to undo Kameks spell and bring all the Toads back. Later a celebration is held as Mario and Luigi are awarded medals for the heroism.

The government says there's nothing to worry about -- it's just a problem with bears making trouble in the mountains and forests of Norway. But local hunters don't believe it -- and neither do a trio of college students who want to find out the truth. Armed with a video camera, they trail a mysterious ""poacher,"" who wants nothing to do with them. However, their persistence lands them straight in the path of the objects of his pursuits: trolls. They soon find themselves documenting every move of this grizzled, unlikely hero -- the trollhunter -- risking their lives to uncover the secrets of creatures only thought to exist in fairy tales.

Brad Pitt's performance in Ad Astra is better than his performance in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood,"I know a lot of people on this sub outright called for an Oscar nomination for Pitt for his role in Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.

Don't get me wrong, it was a good performance, but I hesitate to call it amazing. It pales in comparison to Leo's performance tbh. Yes, Cliff is a lot more likeable then Rick, but that's largely due to writing. All things considered, Cliff Booth was quite a one dimensional character. The strong silent stoif archetype is certainly likeable....Pitt brought a tremendous charisma to the role but it's not Oscar worthy.

Now I'm not saying Pitt's performance in Ad Astra is oscar worthy, compared to other lead performances, it just isn't (on a side note, I hope Taron Egerton wins for Rocketman). However, I think its superior to his performance in Once Upon A Time.

Pitt nails Ad Astra. He starts off as the quiet stoic type (similar to Cliff, his character Cliff not his dad lol, cos his dad in Ad Astra is also called Cliff). However as the film progresses we see the character eventually break down. Pitt executes the layered and nuanced character rather well...and I think he hits every beat perfectly.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMredxw8bE4

If you see the above CNN interview, its immediately apparent that Ad Astra is more of an emotional role for Pitt. Pitt is able to bring the emotions of his real life struggle and channel them into his character in Ad Astra....I think his performance was compelling and certainly superior to his character in Once Upon. 

His Ad Astra character has about the same amount of lines, if not less than Cliff in Once Upon. But I think he does it better.",movies,1569107251,throwawaysgkwm,8,6,True,2019-09-21

Underworld - Rise of the Lycans 2009 - Movie Question,"Why did sonja never try to escape? I mean, Victor never increased security around her place, except to tell the door guards that she is not to escape and I highly doubt that there was anyone watching her window specifically.

So, she could theoretically grab some cloaks and wrap herself properly while everyone is sleeping and then just sneak off.

Or if that weren't possible, then maybe sneak off to the unbolter sewage grater and escape that way, since while Victor knew about that and had prepped for it, he never placed any watch guards there.

Regardless of how practical, realistic or whatever. I don't understand why Sonja never tried to escape, since she planned to do so anyway, because she MUST have known that they'd try to bring Lucian back by using her.

It's true that they were going to replace Lucian, but the man had just witnessed his slave fucking his daughter. Why the hell wouldn't he go on a vendetta and make it his coverns mission to hunt down and re enslave or kill Lucian by using his daughter as bait?

It just feels poorly written in this area and a potentially huge plot hole. They should have never ignored this part, because Sonja would not have given up so easily, as she's shown that she is a fighter, a free thinker and a rebellious one quite often throughout the movie.

"After Endgame and It Chapter 2, I'm starting to think there should be more 3-hour movies","So yeah, I saw It Chapter 2 and one of the bigger aspects of it that I heard before seeing it was that it's roughly 3 hours long with some critics treating this as a negative against the film but I was kind of excited to be able to sit through a 3 hour movie because it made me feel like this is exactly the movie that the people behind it wanted to make. It wasn't cut down for time and so we end up losing certain scenes that may or may not be important, we get to see it all.

For the last decade or so, I've noticed a trend in film criticism that whenever a movie is 2 and a half hours long (or god forbid goes past that), you get a lot of people complaining that the movie was too long and that ""you could have cut 20 minutes out of the movie and you wouldn't have missed anything"". I see that two of the more common reasons for this is that people are apparently so restless that they can't sit in one spot for a few hours or that some people have very tiny bladders and don't want to go to the bathroom because they might miss something.

We live in a time where people will openly boast about how they're going to binge the newest season of whatever on Netflix and since most of those shows can have seasons with 10 episodes, each roughly an hour long, it confuses me that people can be so happy to allocate a whole day to this but can't do it for a movie that exceeds 2 hours.

To be more positive, I do really enjoy movies that take all the time they need to tell the story they want to tell because it's never fun to watch a movie, enjoy it and then read online that there was like 30 minutes of extra footage that had to be cut for time (and even worse when those scenes end up providing some much needed context for other scenes). In time, I wouldn't even mind if we started seeing 4-hour movies for some of the bigger event movies that maybe have an intermission 2 hours in because honestly, with some of the prices for tickets these days, you might as well get the most out of it.

Ad Astra Review,"I was fortunate to catch this movie in the IMAX theater as the visuals are stunning! Every frame was handled with so much care and the performance from Brad Pitt was excellent. 

Unfortunately, the movie as a whole is very slow and doesn't build to very much. The best scenes took place in the first half of the film. I found its climax to be very anti-climactic and the movie was extremely nihilistic. I guess the message is when you're depressed or feeling disconnected, find someone in a worse state than you're in to give you a better perspective on your life. 

Overall, if you're going to see this, see it on a big IMAX screen, but don't expect your mind to be blown away by the story.

Did Jordan Peele Rip Off Skeleton Key with Get Out?,"Please hear me out.

Skeleton Key is a great horror film from the 90's, and if you watch it now, it almost acts as a complete blueprint for Get Out.

This is tough because I really don't wanna ruin the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it, but the similarities are legit kind of surreal.

Takes place in deep south, based on weird deep south traditions. Established, upper class family brings in an outsider to bring normalcy and such, but beneath the shiny exterior there is something much more nefarious happening. The lead character in the film is bought out there to take care of an invalid man (improper language, sorry) who cannot speak or take care of himself.

You see early on that this man has a constant look of terror in his eyes, like he is TRYING to tell her something but can't.

As the film goes on, you come to find out that where they were was rich with a history of voodoo, and there are some (frankly, dope) plot twists that all kind of culminate with a twist ending I would put on par with The Sixth Sense. Yes, that good of a reveal (even if it is sort of obvious by end where it has to be going).

&amp;#x200B;

Suffice it to say  with no spoilers, the main themes of the film are social class and race, and there is also some odd ""race swapping"" coincidences you can find in there as well.

&amp;#x200B;

We KNOW that Peele wears his inspirations on his sleeve ( the opening shot of US mirrors Funny Games, note for note, right down to family vibing out to music from different generations). Film also has some very odd things in common with the 80's Carpenter film, Prince of Darkness. VERY ODD, to say the least.

My point is, as good as Peele's work has been and has the potential to be, I don't think any of these are honestly his original ideas. To not name drop Skeleton Key when talking about Get Out is a tad bit questionable.

Kevin Hart and Bryan Cranston have that much needed personality, and great chemistry; their friendship over the course of the film is heartwarming and really makes you feel good...
The bond forms early and that does leave me feeling like they had no real hurdle in their way, they just kind of click and then we watch them jackass around for 2 hours...

Ad Astra tripped at the finish line,"I was totally on board with this movie for the first 2 acts. Obviously the amazing visuals were a huge part of that, but I also loved the whole planet hopping, Heart of Darkness in space thing this movie had going on. I actually liked the voice over as well, I thought it worked for this movie, made it feel like experiencing the personal diary of an astronaut with daddy issues.

Plus c'mon fuckin baboons in space, moon marauders, mutiny on Mars. There were some really wacky events in this movie that gave it a lot of character. Plus the opening scene with his fall from the antenna was pretty great. 

However, the movie totally falls apart once he gets to Neptune and meets his father. 

First of all, the entire thing felt sort of anticlimactic, and his father felt like Kurtz light. 

What really bugged me however was one of the stupidest things I've seen in a space movie. He fucking floats through the rings of Neptune, unscathed, using a goddamn panel as a shield.

Does James Grey not realize how fucking fast that material has to be going to stay in orbit? v = sqrt[g(neptune)*r] which is really motherfucking fast, like bullet fast, Brad Pitt would have been annihilated. Not to mention apparently in the movie the rings of Neptune region is only like 20 meters thick, which is preposterous. 

Plus apparently he doesn't understand the concepts of gravity or momentum, everything about them floating outside of Neptune and basically swimming through space was just fucking dumb. 

Then of course after all that he just somehow floats through the rings of Neptune and goes right back to his shuttle, which he somehow pilots all the way back to Earth. 

Oh and also how using the same combustion rockets that we use today, Roy travelled from Earth to fucking Neptune and back in a matter of what like 10 years tops? Get outta here lol

Stuff this silly wouldn't bother me if the movie wasn't so damn pretentious. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Ad Astra makes the argument that there exists no intelligent life in the universe outside of humanity, that we are alone in the universe and that Earth is where we belong, and in general space travel is more or less not worth it. 

If a movie is going to have these sort of anti-scientific themes, it better not have some stupid shit like an astronaut floating through the rings of Neptune.

What exactly makes The Last Jedi great in the eyes of critics?,"I watched it again last night just to recap and none of my initial dislike for the movie subsided. I thought since the hate train has subsided I might actually like it, but I‚Äôm just reminded how much I hate this movie. Take note I‚Äôm just a casual Star Wars fan. I only watch the movies and ignore the books and shows. I have fairly good knowledge of the lore, but not enough to have a great in depth discussion or make theories about it. So the usual excuse of I just hate change or I just want a rehash of the original trilogy isn‚Äôt true. I have valid reasons to dislike the movie and I‚Äôm hoping that I can finally have a civil discussion about hose points without all the name calling. So here are my gripes about the film:

1. Of course people will hate how they try to erase the past. This movie wouldn‚Äôt have made billions of people weren‚Äôt so fond of the original trilogy in the first place. What they did wasn‚Äôt asking us to forget the past, they basically just spit on it and heavily disrespected the core fanbase. The PR response to people who hated the movie made it worst, telling them not to watch if they don‚Äôt like it.
2. I can accept Luke being grumpy, a lot of things can happen for him to end up that way. But him wanting to kill Ben just because he senses the attraction to the dark side is incredibly out of character. This is the dude who believes he can convert his dad who was full on the dark side, not just attracted to it. Plus the milk scene. Don‚Äôt disrespect the character like that, just don‚Äôt. 
3. The jokes just didn‚Äôt land. Not only was the cellphone and yo mama joke out of place, it just didn‚Äôt land. Like no one in my theatre was laughing at all. Plus the MCU formula just doesn‚Äôt work on them. The MCU has always been comedy centric, yes sometimes it becomes annoying but generally they land. Plus some of the best comedy directors and actors are working for them so they just have better execution.
4. The whole Canto Bight subplot. What was the point? For Disney to teach us about greed? The whole movie can just delete that part and it might actually be better. A lot of people in my theatre were actually using their phones during this scene, not a good sign. 
5. Rose Tico. Let‚Äôs be honest, she was only added to pander to the Chinese audience. That‚Äôs not a bad thing overall, the Asian characters in Rogue One were pretty good. Rose Tico is pretty annoying and just not a fun character to watch. The problem is how anyone who admits this is deemed racist by fans who loved the movie instead of trying to convince us why she‚Äôs a good character (I‚Äôm Asian btw).
6. The whole romance between Rose and Finn. They have zero chemistry and entirely one sided. Like Rose kissing Finn by surprise, Finn didn‚Äôt even looked like he liked it. Pretty sure in real life that counts as assault in a way.
7. General Holdo. Yup Poe was reckless and should be restrained, but at least tell people your plan cause a whole lot of people and disagreements could have been saved. 
8. Leia Poppins
9. Rey continues to be a Mary Sue. I can accept that she‚Äôs powerful, but the problem is she never legitimately struggles at all.
10. Snoke is extremely powerful with the force, but couldn‚Äôt sense Kylo Ren using it to cut him in half. 
11. They did Admiral Ackbar dirty. 

So these are the complaints I can list down. I‚Äôm open to any rebuttals for those who sincerely loved it and agree with critics. For those who hated it like I did, what were your complaints?",movies,1569126277,mgmmspud,108,0,True,2019-09-22

Your most memorable movie going experiences?,"Hi. I'm sure this sort of idea has been done to death on here but as a cinephile I would like to share my thoughts about one of my favorite things to do, that being going to the cinema. I have so many memories connected to those popcorn covered floors, those sticky seats, the previews before the movie, etc. As an anxious person I have always found it soothing when those lights begin to dim as the movie starts. It can be full of people but as soon as those lights fade into darkness I feel completely alone and my problems fade away for the next two or so hours. It has always been quite therapeutic for me although I am not sure why. 

My grandmother and I have had a tradition that every time we see each other we go and see a movie. One of my first memories of this is Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man. For whatever reason my parents believed Spider-Man was evil at the time. This logic didn't make sense then and certainly doesn't make sense now but I digress. My parents would not let me see the movie as it somehow conflicts with their Christian values so my grandparents house was a little safe haven for my Spider-Man obsession. A place where I could watch the cartoons and read the comics without fear of judgement. 

While spending the weekend at their house I managed to convince Nan to take me to see the movie on the condition that I don't tell my parents. I had trouble sleeping the night before, that's how excited I was to see this movie. When the lights dimmed and that glorious theme song by Danny Elfman (a song I still listen to on Spotify by the way) began to play I was instantly transported into this universe and have been a Marvel fan ever since. 

Another moment I remember was going to see The Tigger Movie. Waiting in line I ran into these older boys who were seeing the Iron Giant. When I told them what I was seeing they scoffed at me and told me Whinnie The Pooh was for babies so I pretended that Nan was forcing me to see it. In the cinema I pretended to hate the movie but secretly enjoyed every sopping bit of it.

My stepdad and I never got along but one thing we had in common was our love for Harry Potter. Our family used to watch Harry Potter religiously at home and would often have movie nights over the weekend where we would put one of the movies on. (this was at a time when they were more relaxed on what was sacrilegious) When Half Blood Prince came out we all decided to go and see it. This would be the first cinema experience we did as a family. And although my step father was often abusive towards me for those precious two hours I felt closer to him then I ever had. We aren't on speaking terms these days and this is one of the only positive memories I have of him which I think proves how films can bring people together.

The most recent experience I am fond of is the release of Avengers: Infinity War. This was the first midnight screening I had ever been to. I couldn't find anyone to go with so I went alone feeling a bit embarrassed that I was by myself. The place was packed with a line that led into the car park. A lot of people dressed up as characters from the movie, something that I was not ballsy enough to do. Every last seat was full and although I came alone I left feeling like I'm apart of a community. Everyone cheered at the exciting parts and audibly gasped at the sadder parts. I'll never forget how a room of 300 people went completely silent at the cliffhanger ending. 

Any who, that's enough of a rant. I have many more fond memories but I will stow them away for another day. I had only just thought about it recently but it really is quite amazing how a place like a movie theater can be connected to so many nostalgic memories. What are your fondest movie going experiences fellow cinephile's?",movies,1566441495,Zwatts121,19,1,True,2019-08-21

In regards to this Sony-Disney fiasco...,"I'll try to keep this short.

It's honestly alarming to me how much people want Spider-Man in the MCU, no matter the cost. A lot of you were criticizing Disney for buying Fox out, saying that Disney is becoming too powerful and that this is bad for the industry. I've come to find that the same people are almost entirely behind Disney in regards to this negotiation over Spider-Man and that fingers are being almost unanimously pointed at Sony.

I love the MCU. I grew up watching it and will continue to watch it as long as films are made. But we're moving towards a point where we're sacrificing the power of studios at the expense of having more characters in our superhero flicks. Yes, it would be cool to see a full Avengers fight the X-Men, but at what cost?

Look at everything that's happening with Jo Jo Rabbit, and how Disney is saying it may not fit their brand and may be too risky to release. Look at how they strong-arm theaters into playing their films on the biggest screen possible for x-amount of weeks, usually three or four. Disney is already having a $4 billion dollar year, and that's before some of their bigger releases later this year -- ie Star Wars and the launch of Disney+.

For once, Sony isn't at fault here. Taking a deal like that wouldn't be effective to them any longer. Unless each Spider-Man film is grossing some $2 billion, it's not beneficial to them. Disney leaked this news as some sort of a power move to show Sony that they **need** them to continue to make money, which is just as messed up as wanting a 50% stake in Spider-Man on top of getting merchandising. They should have made a counteroffer to negotiate with, maybe, but it comes down to Disney being greedy and thinking they can bully other studios, at the end of the day.

All I'm saying, if I'm saying anything at all, is that we need to be careful of how we're voicing our support and whether or not we can accept that Disney is in the wrong here. We don't know the full story, but blindly accepting Disney to be right is setting a dangerous precedent that could turn ugly when they start to get too comfortable.",movies,1566442222,nightmonkeyforever,0,1,True,2019-08-21

My idea on how Sony can easily recover from this whole Disney disaster.,"The sad thing about all this is how easily Sony can walk away from this. Disney/Marvel needs Spider-Man way more than Sony needs the MCU. 

MCU is built all on Peter. Sony just can‚Äôt mention the MCU. That‚Äôs not hard for them at all. How do they do it?

Peter runs off to San Francisco. Who is there? Venom. Somewhere along the line, Peter is killed by Carnage or someone else. This inspires Venom to be a hero. 

This ends the Peter and MCU problem, and continuing the storyline of posing Venom as a hero. 

This completely fucks over the MCU. And Sony goes to ‚Äúrenegotiate‚Äù. Disney is deemed as bad guy because they don‚Äôt want anything to do with Sony anymore.

From the opening scene, the score gives it a much more approachable feel (think Luhrman's The Great Gatsby, but without all the pretentiousness of a Luhrman movie). 

The director, Chanya Button, whom I had never heard of before, managed to breathe life into a story that's been told before. The performances from Gemma Arterton and Elizabeth Debicki, not to mention the supporting cast, were all incredible.

This movie proved me wrong on so many levels. I hope Chanya Button gets more opportunities in the future. I love when people like that challenge a story like Virginia Woolf, and they do it so beautifully.

"Question: If you completely forgot about a movie that you love, do you really love that movie?","Whenever I get into a ‚Äúfavorite movies?‚Äù Conversation with people, I usually say the same ones

Today, I found a clip from Good Will, Hunting on my Youtube feed and I realized that I completely forgot all about that movie - but I absolutely love it! Definitely top 5 favorite. 

But then it got me wondering. Do I *really* love it as much as I think I do, if I can just easily forget it?",movies,1566455376,spwf,7,1,True,2019-08-22
Let‚Äôs Talk Perspective ‚Äì Discussing Character/Camera Control in Ari Aster‚Äôs Midsommar (Spoilers),"I finally got a chance to see *Midsommar*, and much like with *Hereditary*, I found myself enraptured by Aster‚Äôs complete sense of control with perspective, and character manipulation. In *Hereditary*, this was done by using the camera to make the entire world feel like a dollhouse, making it seem as if none of the characters ever had control over their actions to begin with. It‚Äôs a story about terrified little marionettes, being guided by forces much greater than themselves. We are voyeurs, watching something wretched unfold. In *Midsommar*, however, we‚Äôre presented with an arguably more terrifying antithesis to Hereditary ‚Äì that the characters are absolutely in control, but their own weaknesses, insecurities, obsessions, and choices end up sucking them deep into the maw of oblivion. 

We as an audience are inextricably bound to the characters and events of the film, as hapless observers ourselves being controlled by what is happening. This is why the choice to use psychedelics, and how they affected the visuals and circumstances of the film, really helped to sell what I think was the main source of horror in the film: loss of agency, helplessness, and the complete sense vulnerability. This brings us to what I‚Äôd like to focus on here: the concept of *perspective*, and how Aster manipulates this to changes the way we understand our relationship with the characters.

First, let‚Äôs talk about how the camera is used to control what you see. At multiple points in the film, Aster utilizes creative scene changes or transitions to blur our sense of time, and make the connections in the story seem more seamless. The focus shifts from character to character, but sometimes lingers to follow a point to its conclusion. The best of example of this is probably when we‚Äôre first *really* introduced to Simon and Connie as characters. All of the main characters (Christian, Dani, Mike, Josh, and Pelle) are walking and talking with these characters we‚Äôve really only just met, those being Simon, Connie and Ulf. They talk together for a bit, but as the conversation progresses you are drawn into their separate narrative, which is becoming somewhat tense. As this happens, the camera starts to follow the motion of the new characters, and the familiar ones we know are seen walking away in the background. This creates a sense of separation between the audience and the characters, with us being drawn away from the comfort of what we know into a conversation that has become somewhat uncomfortable with characters we don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs subtle, but this detail changes the way we see these characters for the rest of the film.

It‚Äôs also important to note that *all* of the visuals we see when the characters have taken drugs are distorted, meaning that we (the observers) are somehow involved in what is happening, or at the very least directly affected by the character‚Äôs choices. We are participants, as if we ourselves chose to take the drugs. I‚Äôm sure that anyone who has experienced psychedelics drugs knew pretty early on that Aster had a good sense of how it affects the psyche, and did a pretty good job of making the visuals work without committing the classic Hollywood faux pas of having vivid hallucinations and ridiculously exaggerated character behavior. And although the visuals are presented very well, I‚Äôd like instead to focus on one aspect of this use of drugs in particular: the concept of self, and how that relates to how the audience sees the character, and how the character sees themselves. 

Dani‚Äôs experience with mushrooms near the start of the film does a great job of illustrating this concept. As the characters start to experience the drugs more, the visuals on the screen become increasingly distorted. Eventually, when we see the grass growing out of her hand, we become aware of what is going on, but it‚Äôs what Aster does next that really starts to shake the audience. Dani starts to panic, and we are abruptly subject to her internal narrative. *This is the only time in the film this occurs.* It is choppy, unnerved and quickly becomes unsettling. She approaches a group of strangers who are laughing, and the neurosis is immediately reflected to the audience. The scene concludes with her seeing a heavily distorted image of herself in a mirror then running away screaming ‚Äì again, all of this being tied to her perspective. The scene ends abruptly, but the camera here stays on her at all times, making the whole scenario seem inevitable, and making us as observers feel helpless. Right up until this point in the film, the audience has had a pretty good sense of how traumatized Dani is from her experiences, but by using these tricks, Aster manages to brings us *into* her mind, and fully reveals just how helpless she feels. This distinctly blurs the line we feel between ourselves and the characters, as we ourselves feel helpless as a result.

Helplessness is also a big theme in how Aster seems to shoot a lot of his most violent scenes. He often holds a shot for much longer than other directors might choose to, and this is uniquely unsettling for the audience. Josh‚Äôs death, in particular, I think embodies this. Let‚Äôs follow the camera as it goes here: Josh sneaks out of bed, and into the barn. The camera holds perspective on his back as he is taking photos of the sacred text. In the mirror, we see ‚ÄúMike‚Äù come in behind him. Josh turns around to face him, and as he does the camera changes to the opposite direction to show him more clearly. The camera‚Äôs direction has followed the direction he has been facing this whole time. As he turns around, he is stricken in the back of the head. We are then given the perspective from the murderer, looking down, and it is a long held shot of Josh struggling to breathe, clearly paralyzed and experiencing his final horrific moments. This shot is held for a *very* long time, just to make absolutely certain that the audience understands where all the power in this scene is. When the shot finally changes, we see that is it someone wearing Mike‚Äôs skin staring down at him and watching him die. Again, as an audience, we are subjected to witness something we unconsciously feel in control of, because of the way the camera is controlling what we see. Those final helpless moments serve to remind us that we have no power in this world, and our vulnerability is subject to not only the choices of the characters, but also the consequences they suffer, too.

This film has an awful lot to unpack, and so far I‚Äôve only seen it the once. I‚Äôm still sorting through so many of the details to form a cohesive opinion, but I wanted to open a discussion about this concept of perspective, control, and power to see what you guys think. Although his films seem somewhat divisive, I would posit that Aster is one of the most powerful voices in the world of cinema these days because he knows *exactly* how he wants to create his scenes, and *exactly* what he wants them to convey.",movies,1566455683,ObeseMorese,1,2,True,2019-08-22

My take on the reimagining of the banana splits movie,"After watching the trailer along  with some reviews  of the horror film reimagining of the banana splits,i think it  is still a  a stupid idea that they should made it into its original form as a five night at freddy's movie especially that fans of the original banana splits hate it as it is disrespectful to the show .So if the studio who made this film should make a proper reimagining movie of the banana splits here's how it goes.

It should be a family comedy film that  will be similar to the muppets 2011 film where the banana splits gang reunite and trying to make a comeback to a new generation of audience with the help of  new members probably their kids while trying to face against an antagonist who might be a parody of a businessman who manage a rip off version of themselves probably a parody of boy bands

Spiderman 4: The origins of Spidergirl.,"Greetings. With the Disney-Sony parting of ways over the Spiderman character for at least the next few years, why not continue the trilogy?  Sure time for Tobey and Kirsten has past, but the chance for them to have a baby, one of the comic children, May for example. Make it adult rated so it could be a bit darker, but have kid friendly version made simultaneously. You then have for aging fanbase the chance to explore tech assisted Peter, using technology from his deceased friend estate. This concept doesnt stop Sony rebooting Spiderman, but a Spidergirl legacy from one of their reboots seems obvious. Both Emma and Kirsten are gorgeous, Kirsten has just embraced motherhood, so why not have a by then 40 year old MJ and a super child?  Thoughts?",movies,1566460299,marktsv,3,0,True,2019-08-22

It's alot more thoughtful. The special effects are very, very well done for the budget and time. It has good scale. V'ger is a towering, hyper-powerful antagonist. One of the most powerful I've ever seen in a movie. And it's a decent twist. It's no, ""I see dead people!"", but it's decent, ain't it? Kirk is great. Spock is great.

I understand why Maggie Gyllenhaal's character would be upset because it took several hours to find her son again and she wasn't there when it happen, and in the end I suppose it was good not-too-serious rock bottom for him to hit before he decided to get better.

Avengers: Endgame - Dr Strange had to hand over the Time Stone.,"It finally dawned on me while watching Endgame through a third time, that Dr Strange handing over the Time Stone in Infinity War wasn‚Äôt just about sparing Tony, it was the only way for him to meaningfully communicate to The Ancient One, that he did it for a reason. That was the only way she would have relinquished the stone to Banner. He tried to undo Quill‚Äôs ‚Äúmistake,‚Äù he tried to keep the stone hidden, letting Tony die, telling Tony his fate in an attempt to save him, all leading up to one form of failure or another. But, the whole reason for Dr Strange handing the Time Stone over why and when he did, was so that Tony would witness it and The Ancient One would learn through Banner that it was intentional.",movies,1566483614,JsDaFax,3,0,True,2019-08-22

Maybe SONY pulling Spider-Man isn‚Äôt a terrible thing,"Let the record show that I love the MCU films more than almost any other series or franchise. But maybe Spider-Man getting pulled isn‚Äôt the worst thing to happen to film as a whole. But it would be for Marvel. As much as I love the MCU movies, their existence hasn‚Äôt done very much to stimulate or grow the art of moviemaking. I‚Äôm not just talking about the artsy movies either, I just mean that the MCU superhero movies don‚Äôt inspire their competition to their creative limits. It inspires clones, like Venom, Justice League and Dark Phoenix. The only great superhero movies that haven‚Äôt been made under Disney recently are Logan, the Deadpool movies, and Spiderverse. But now that Disney owns Fox, the future for Deadpool May be in jeopardy. But there is one studio that made something really special, and that‚Äôs Sony. Granted, they also made Venom, but it shows that they have it in them to make something spectacular. 
So what would happen if Spider-Man was pulled? The MCU would lose one of their best leads for the upcoming team up films, which could make future team up movies unlikely. The roster of big faces are Dr Strange, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and Spider-Man. But Chadwick Boseman doesn‚Äôt want to keep making Black P movies, so he probably won‚Äôt make it through phase 4. Strange could possibly make it through phase 4, but I don‚Äôt think that he would make for an iconic leader as much as Iron Man or Cap did. Captain Marvel will absolutely be around for a long time, but it is questionable as to whether or not she would be enough to carry the movies. That leaves the Guardians, which are not prone to team ups, and Thor, who is in no state to be teaming up with new Avengers. If Spider-Man left, it could jeopardize the future of the MCU. But perhaps the MCU getting largely disbanded could be good. This year, Disney has pumped out three live action remakes and none of them were received well critically. The Star Wars franchise has turned its fans against each other so much that they are one of the most self destructive fan bases out there. Disney hasn‚Äôt proven that they an make both quantity and quality, and with the massive influx of Marvel content on the horizon because of Disney Plus, it isn‚Äôt guaranteed that it will all be good. Sony could be pulling Spider-Man to sabotage Marvel, and if they don‚Äôt make great content for Disney Plus, it could cause the whole franchise to suffer greatly. I would love to discuss with y‚Äôall about what this would do, both positive and negative, for film as a whole.

Most impactfule moments in movies,"Most impactful moments in movies

&amp;#x200B;

After thinking about it for a little bit, I have come to the conclusion that the greatest movies of all time have some common threads. Focusing on one I think impactful moments really distinguish a good movie from the great. I am talking about moments that manage to say the most with the least screen time. These are the moments which give you goosebumps because you realize that you are watching peak cinema. Here are a few examples:

&amp;#x200B;

1. The Godfather II - Perhaps a little overt, but the moment when Michael Corleone hugs Fredo to ""forgive"" him at their mother's funeral. Then looks at Al Neri, and Al understands. It is a simple scene - but manages to convey several things - Michael's ruthlessness, the fact that even Neri - a hitman - is shocked at what he is being asked to do, and Fredo's gullibility.

&amp;#x200B;

2. Spirited Away - It has been a while since I saw this movie, but near the end when Chihiro is going back to her world, she asks the Dragon boy if they will see each other again. He says that of course they will. But when she finally leaves his hand to cross the river, the camera lingers on the outstretched hand of the boy for just a second longer than it would. It manages to convey without a doubt that the boy knows they will never meet each other again - at least not in the way that they have before.

&amp;#x200B;

3. The Godfather - The moment near the end of the film where Kay point blank asks Michael if he killed Carlo and he - after stalling for a bit - looks into her eyes and says he did not. But then the film ends and without overhearing a conversation, or discovering plot heavy papers - Kay just knows, by the way Michael stands and lets himself be greeted by others - that he did everything he said he did not.

&amp;#x200B;

4. The Dark Knight - The interrogation scene is a little longer than most moments here, but there is a specific point in it where Bruce stops being angry and starts to understand just who he is dealing with. The look of utter disbelief mingled with almost fear is perfectly displayed by Christian Bale as he stops beating Joker and realizes that he is probably going to lose Rachel.

&amp;#x200B;

Are there any other moments like this that you can think of? I am sure I am missing a whole lot, probably from the classics as well as the blockbusters.",movies,1566488450,totoropoko,9,3,True,2019-08-22
Brain fart regarding the future of Spider-Man (ex-MCU),"Now that the marriage between Disney and Sony has ended in a divorce, and Spider-Man not being able to join the MCU again, I was wondering something regarding the future of the Spider-Man movies.

Spider-Man ended with Peter being the (spiritual) successor of Tony Stark, and him maturing into a leader of his own. The chance of seeing Peter Parker as a leader or senior member of The Avengers have vanished like snow in the sun, and the future for future installments/movies seem very uncertain. What are they going to do with the character like it is now?

That got me thinking: they could simply reboot the franchise - but let's hope they don't! But I think they can continue with Tom Holland's MCU Spider-Man. The answer: the multiverse. 

What if, in the next movie, Spider-Man is being transported to another universe? It is possible, since the multiverse became a (hypothetical) thing/possibility in 'Far From Home'. 

Now, I believe that - although Sony doesn't own the characters like Iron Man etc. - that they (Sony) can still make references to these characters? Be it as a 'cultural reference', and that even referring to things like 'Earth-616' and 'the multiverse' should be considered possible. 

In this new universe, the Spider-Man that we know could end up in a world where The Avengers don't even exist or aren't alive anymore. He could go on a solo adventure of his own, that would reference/cameo all things MCU/Avengers, but that would not actually use these characters as a crucial element of its story. 

It's out of the box, but I think it would a great way of keeping with a wonderful character that has a fully developed arc, then to rather reboot and start over - risking rubbish. 

So, what's your take/two cents on this?",movies,1566488508,Yonix360,2,0,True,2019-08-22

"In light of the recent Sony/Spider-Man drama, it‚Äôs worth looking at Sony‚Äôs recent history with franchises (since 2010)","Sony has always been looking to have a stable of franchises - they are in a tough spot compared to other major studios. Only a few of their properties are widely recognized, basically just Spider Man and James Bond. The others are quite a bit more niche, like Hotel Transylvania or Men in Black. The last 10 years are littered with failed franchise attempts, reboots, or squandered opportunities. Here is the state of Sony Pictures since 2010, as told by some of their attempted franchises.

Men In Black (2012, 2019): Beloved franchise from the early 2000s. Sony‚Äôs attempt at #3 ~10-15 years later was not a financial success. Neither was the franchise reboot - a Thor and Valkyrie team-up movie. Sounds good on paper, though! (I had to check to verify that this movie had already come out - yes, it did. Maybe by June 2019 people only wanted Fat Hemsworth.)

James Bond (2012, 2015): Skyfall‚Äôs huge success surprised Sony executives, who scrambled to retain the director (Sam Mendes) for the next Bond movie, and ended up paying gobs of money to bribe him to stay - he wanted a break. His next movie, Spectre, was a critical and commercial disappointment. Until recently the next Bond was still in limbo as an important anniversary year, i.e., normally an easy cash-in opportunity, approaches. 

Adam Sandler movies (2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2015): Sandler has moved on to Netflix now, but he had a pretty stunning run of awful movies at Sony (Jack and Jill, Grown Ups, That‚Äôs My Boy, Pixels, etc).

21 Jump Street (2012, 2014): These movies are great - but where does Sony go from here? Apparently nowhere. Maybe they should have went with the Men In Black crossover after all. 

Spider-Man (2012, 2014): Like every other studio, after the success of Avengers, Sony was stretching to create a Cinematic Universe. They attempted to spin the Amazing Spider-Man reboot into a Cinematic Universe - but just of spider-man‚Äôs villains... However, Amazing Spider-Man 2 couldn‚Äôt get its own villains off the ground, and couldn‚Äôt match the 1 billion dollar gross that Sony set as a goal (which doesn‚Äôt sound too unrealistic today in the midst of the post-Disney-monopalypse billions, but was a terrible miscalculation by Sony executives who expected audiences to show up to a Spider-Man sequel whether or not it was good). In an extremely unusual &amp; humiliating arrangement, Sony canceled its villain movie plans (and its Aunt May standalone spin-off movie - yes, really), and gave Marvel Studios creative control of Spider-Man. Sony would pay production costs of Marvel spider-man stand-alone movies, and any profit from these movies would go to Sony. Marvel can use Spider-Man in its movies as a supporting character with impunity. Sony can still make its own non-MCU movies with other characters from the Spider-Man catalog.

Total Recall (2012): Remake of beloved-ish? 80s sci-fi action movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger - with Colin Farrell in Arnold‚Äôs place. Sounds great to me! But it wasn‚Äôt, and it bombed hard. 

RoboCop (2014): Remake of beloved 80s action movie which was loved for its pulpy violence and political commentary.... remade as a sanitized PG13 meh-fest, and potential franchise starter, that bombed critically and commercially.

After Earth (2013): Will Smith was like, ‚ÄúHey Sony - my son is great, give him a job!‚Äù Sony said, ‚ÄúYour son is great!‚Äù and put him in this movie. They were both wrong.

3 Smurfs Movies (2011, 2013, 2017): Maybe these movies are good! I haven‚Äôt seen them. I believe Katy Perry is the voice of one of the recurring smurfs, and I like that Justin Timberlake song. So maybe this is a Sony Franchise success. 

Angry Birds Movie (2016, 2019): Another sony attempt at a franchise starter that didn‚Äôt connect with audiences. The recent sequel is now the best-reviewed video game movie of all time! But at this point, Angry Birds is a relic of 2010 and the sequel looks to be a mild flop. 

Ghostbusters remake (2016): Yet another franchise starter attempt - you know the story on this one. At the time Sony executives were defiant re: the box office numbers, saying, ‚Äúthis movie is a huge success - look at all the free publicity!‚Äù But yeah, they‚Äôre not making a sequel, because it didn‚Äôt make money. They are, however, trying ANOTHER reboot, directed by the original director‚Äôs son..... We‚Äôll see. 

Dark Tower (2017): Attempt at Stephen King franchise that people have been waiting for for decades - when it finally came out it was a huge mess that fizzled hard.

Jumanji 2 (2017): At the time, was at the tail end of Sony‚Äôs string of failed reimaginings of classic movies. Executives by this point had given up on making this a franchise starter and let the creative team make controversial decisions (like an emphasis on the non-celebrity high school characters) - which was good for the movie but Sony of 2012 would have nixed. Ultimately it was hoped that this movie would just make its money back and Sony‚Äôd move on. Instead, the film was a massive hit, and Sony scrambled to get plans in place for a sequel.  

Venom (2018): Long in development, with the final product looking nothing like what Tom Hardy signed on for. Ultimately middle school boys all agreed that this movie was awesome anyway, and it was a success commercially (although not critically). A sequel is on the way, and all it took was Tom Hardy swallowing his acting scruples and just taking his paycheck. Concerningly, Venom‚Äôs ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù may have convinced the Sony executive team that actually, they‚Äôre all really smart, and maybe they should have been as involved in the Into the SpiderVerse movie as they were with Venom.

Girl in the Spider‚Äôs Web (2018): The first Girl with the Dragon Tattoo movie was good, and a modest success 10 years ago... the next entry in the franchise was last year, based on a book not written by the series‚Äô original author (even though there were two of the original books still remaining to be made into movies) and a we-hope-you-won‚Äôt-notice recasting of the main character. Well, no one noticed this movie coming out, except book fans who felt annoyed.

Into the Spider-Verse (2018): Before the release of Venom, someone at Sony seemed to have recognized that their executive team has no idea what they‚Äôre doing with the Spider Man property, and decided to give the creatives a chance. A hands-off approach was taken for this wacky idea from the creative mind of Phil Lord (the Lego Movie and 21 Jump Street), with decisions that would have once been unthinkable: Peter Parker as only a supporting character (and also as a pancaked character, depending on the universe). The resulting critical success may further go to Sony executives‚Äô heads - ‚ÄúI did this!‚Äù ‚ÄúListen to my great idea for a standalone Jamie-Foxx-as-Electro movie‚Äù... ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs make Spider-Verse 2 be a rom com!‚Äù

Do you find it to be true that really good English language horror films are in a bit of a low period compared to the past 50 or so years?

-----------------------------------------------


Since many will ask, I can speak very much about the 1996-2002 era. These films certainly had a lot more impact on culture than most horror movies in the past 10-12 years. These were movies everyone was talking about at that time and movies that were watched by large audience, not a niche audience. 

1996: Scream - $170m, I Know What You Did Last Summer - $115m

1999: Sixth Sense - $450m, Blair Witch Project - $221m,

2001:  The Others - $140m

2002: Signs - $325m, The Ring - $184m

I kinda expected agent Mills to kill Doe because of anger (wrath) and to die later in the movie, maybe killed by a trap that Doe set up before he died. But still, if the murderer wanted to keep his straight line of only killing people that commited a sin, he either needed to kill another person that was envyous or must have been envyous himself. And that¬¥s kinda where my thinking began.

When I saw what happened, (Doe killed Mills\` wife and unborn child to make him commit the last murder, the Envy-kill I guess) I couldnt really set the pieces all together, because imo there are two plotholes that kidna ruin the movie for me in the aftermath:

1. The murderer, when he was asked by Mills, why he kills all those innocent people, says that they werent innocent because they commited a deadly sin. So he should see himself as a punisher for deadly sins, which wants to wake up the society with a series of murders (make people realize what terrible stuff they basicly do every day). But only a few scenes later he breaks this philosophy by admitting to Mills, that he killed his wife and unborn child because he was envyous (which makes him the envy-kill right?). So he says that he actually killed two completely innocent people (especially the unborn child) just to make Mills kill him. This kinda destroys the whole antagonist for me and makes him just a crazy motherf\*\* instead of a fanatic that wants to show the society how bad everything has become.
2. Also directly connected to the last scene: If people were only killed for deadly sins in this series of murders, there is one that¬¥s still missing, which is the wrath-one (Agent Mills). Imo he actually needed to die in the end, since he commited a deadly sin aswell here. Otherwhise there are only 6 people who died because they were punished for their sins, not 7. And since Mills commited wrath, he should be killed (Doe-logic). But he doesn¬¥t die, his wife and child die, which makes absolutely no sense... Either Doe just used Mills\` family to make him angry, so he makes the Envy-kill and also commits Wrath, but then still Mills needs to die and the murderer breaks his rules. Or he punished Mills for wrath by killing his family instead of him, which still makes Doe kill innocent people and makes it kind of uncompleted aswell, 7 people are dead but not exactly the 7 that sinned (which was the special thing about the antagonist and made him somehow relateable).

Now not only does this plothole destroy the antagonist¬¥s intension and philosophy, but also the movies ""message"" for me. If Doe really only killed people that sinned and maybe somehow managed to kill Mills after he was killed himself, without killing his wife and child in the first place, all of it would have made so much more sense to me. Also the movie would have had much more serious social criticism in it. 

Because in the end: What would happen if you would actually die whenever you commit a deadly sin, probably most of us would die close to every day. The antagonist could have been some kind of  ""antihero"" that wanted to wake up society with a boom (kind of like joker in The Dark Knight), but became only a crazy serial killer by the end of the movie.

What is the most harsh/unfair MPAA rating given to a movie?,"The MPAA has been frequently criticized for giving unfair/harsh ratings to movies, i.e. giving a movie with tame content a PG-13/R rating. 

For example, the documentary film ‚ÄúThis Film Is Not Yet Rated‚Äù brings up multiple allegations of unfair treatment towards certain films. Some examples include giving movies with homosexual content a higher rating, major studios getting more of a pass than independent filmmakers, maintaining secretive appeals processes, giving movies that are important for young people to see an R rating, etc. Several important figures in the industry have also been critical of the agency, especially Roger Ebert, who has written multiple columns criticizing the agency, including [this one](https://www.rogerebert.com/rogers-journal/ugly-reality-in-movie-ratings). 

So, what movies have been treated unfairly by the MPAA? One example in my opinion is School of Rock, which has a few cuss words and one inappropriate joke that would probably go over most kid‚Äôs heads. Despite the movie being for kids and about kids, it has a PG-13 rating. Another example is Bully, a documentary film that is made for kids to seriously discuss bullying famously received an R rating. 

What movies can you think of that received an unfair rating by the MPAA?",movies,1566495017,disablednerd,84,43,True,2019-08-22

"Where are you from, and do people act disruptive in theaters where you live?","I see a lot of complaints on the internet about people being disruptive in theaters.

I've lived in South Jersey, North Jersey, and PA, and am kind of wondering if this is a regional thing. 

So my question is: Where are you from? How often are your movies significantly disturbed by the actions or behaviors of the other attendees?

Search for a Childhood movie!,"Hello everyone, 

I remember seeing a movie as a child, but I can't come up with the name and searched the internet high and low, but no luck! I hope maybe someone here remembers it? 

It's about 2 sisters, i think around the ages of 3 and 11, in a house. They find some sort of gem, my strongest guess was a Sapphire, but I'm not sure. I am sure it was red! They find a secret opening under the stairs and end up in a kingdom, with a castle. It also contains an evil woman (Don't remember witch or queen) who wants to take it over and desperately wants the red gem. I know in the end the smaller girl puts the gem in the middle of some sort of throne room and ballroom and restores the power and saves everyone.

I also know it used classical music, but I don't remember quite which. The movie itself looked pretty old, like the animation. Maybe 50s or 60s? I could be wrong about it.

‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ  

Boy, am I torn on this movie. I went in cheering for this movie a lot and was hoping for it to be great, but i just never got to the level I was hoping for. I came to this movie through a recommendation by Jemaine Clement, who starred in the other 2014 New Zealand horror-supernatural-comedy, What We Do In The Shadows.

I'll do some pros and cons on this one to explain how I ended up giving only a 3 out of 5 star review.

Pros:

- Great production, well acted
- Genuinely interesting mystery hook
- Lead actress deserves special attention for being very compelling

Cons:

- I did not laugh as much as I hoped. Went in open minded, was disappointed in the comedy

- If it was scarier, that would have been fine, but most of the horror fell flat as well.

This is all very, very subjective, so your experience may vary. I would still recommend this movie to anyone interested in New Zealand cinema or horror-comedies. It is by no means bad, but I was hoping for more.",movies,1566497407,Mahaloth,0,0,True,2019-08-22

"""Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence"" by Nagisa √îshima and starring David Bowie is so good, you guys. Haunting and lyrical and the score by Ryuchi Sakamoto is a masterpiece. It's a must for any movie buff.","I loved this movie. It's kind of confusing at times because the film has a soft approach in that it doesn't give you the full development,. you're supposed to interpret the story by yourself as it deals with British Soldiers in a Japanese Camp during World War II and how a Japanese captain becomes obsessed with a captured British soldier. We're never fully aware what kind of obsession it is, though it's heavily implied to be romantic. David Bowie was already out of his Ziggy Stardust phase but he still had that mesmerizing glow about himself and he's so excellent in this movie. 

A major subplot involve Bowie's Jack Celliers and his inability to forgive himself over what happened to his kid brother. Bowie is revered as a singer but I always feel his acting skills don't get enough love and here is is outstanding. 

Ryuchi Sakamoto who not only scores the movie but plays the Captain is quite good as well. √îshima cast him as Yonoi because he reminded him of Mishima who was a major inspiration for how √îshima saw that role. 

The movie also is pretty brutal and raw in how it depicts the mistreatment of British prisoners under Japan. There's one scene which I found hard to watch.

Need help remembering the name of this move!,"Pretty sure it was a kid's movie from either 80s/90s/early 2000s. 

All I remember is the scene where a medieval king guy is in a kid‚Äôs modern room, so it may be about time travel. This king/noble fellow thinks a computer is a piano/musical instrument. He begins to sing while typing on the keys, and a computer game turns on. He watches the game for a few seconds and then as he wasn't doing anything ""loses"" and a monster head comes up and says he is a loser or some other insult and king guy gets angry at it. I want to say I saw this on Disney Channel but maybe not. I know it it's not Catweazle because I remember the king guy had a big beard and like royal garments.

What‚Äôs an overlooked movie from your favorite director(s)?,"For example, l‚Äôve been thinking about checking out the Sergio Leone film *Duck, You Sucker!* that has decent reviews but is a film that wouldn‚Äôt touch his top 5 movies for most people. (A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More, The Good the Bad and the Ugly, Once Upon A Time in the West, Once Upon A Time In America)

My picks would be movies like:

*Cape Fear* from Martin Scorsese - Haven‚Äôt seen this movie in a long time but really liked what I remembered. Robert De Niro is insane in this movie (both figuratively and literally) and it‚Äôs a great thriller. Don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd put it super high in his filmography but it would probably be closer to the top than the bottom.

*Insomnia* from Christopher Nolan - This one plays it pretty safe, and is probably the least Nolan-y Nolan movie, but I enjoyed it a lot as well. Robin Williams is great, and I thought the ending was pretty strong. Many people put this as his worst movie, but I might sneak it over 1 or 2 movies of his.

Most Demanding/Difficult Actors To Work With,"What actors and actresses are the ones who are notoriously difficult or demanding to work with and people in the industry generally dread working with on anything? Some have a bad reputation for sure but like everything else in life, some are just far worse than others.

There's Horror stories galore about Steven Seagal that have gone on for years and hearing so many of them it's a wonder he still gets work at all, even if it's in DTV dreck he keeps doing these days. I came across this discussion topic elsewhere (http://www.steven-seagal.net/xen/index.php?threads/stories-about-seagal-from-directors-co-stars.14937/) that's full of all sorts of negative accounts and experiences from people who've worked with him. It's a surprise he hasn't been blacklisted for some of his antics.

Val Kilmer is another with a super bad rep, at least back in the day. He especially had a pretty bad reputation during the filming of the ill-fated remake of The Island Of Dr. Moreau, which solidifed his negative reputation and probably did more than a little to damage his star power at the time. Much as a fan as I am of his, Tommy Lee Jones is another who's reputed to not be the friendliest or most easygoing of people to work with in the industry.",movies,1566509672,Skeleton_Warrior,234,77,True,2019-08-22

We see how costuming and makeup works. We see a stuntman. A director directing an episode of a tv show. We see a business deal between a talent agent and a client.

Theory On Marvel Studios Moves - TL;DR: Disney Is Anticipating The Commercial Collapse Of Cinemas,"Here's the Marvel news I'm referring to: Spider-Man is out of the MCU, maybe Feige.

There's also ongoing drama - subject of difference of opinion and controversy, but worth considering - over politically based decision making in the MCU that has upset some fans.  Truth be told, there are semi-plausible conspiracy theories about ticket sales, but it's more in Star Wars where we see direct evidence of upset fandom leading to commercial consequences.  Still, this implies a risk to audience retention when politics are inserted to heavily into the production and marketing of films.  That is, the old conventional wisdom is to just stay as neutral as possible when you don't have to actually be controversial.  So why would they court controversy?

Plus, we have the arrival of Disney+.  

This is the environment surrounding the entrance of MCU Phase 4 where major Phase 3 tentpoles (Black Panther, Guardians of the Galaxy, even Thor) are being delayed.  There are no announced Avengers or replacement team movies.  The keystone, and only hook, of Phase 4 is Spider-Man, and that brings us back to the news.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my theory: Cinemas are dying in the US.  It has been a phenomenon for years, decades even.  I honestly am not sure how inevitable it is (so many blockbusters with bad bad scripts, and goofy clown writers who keep getting work).  Plus, if they made more formulaic, middle budget films, and lowered ticket prices, maybe more people would come back?

I'm betting Disney's market analytics says that there are too many substitute products for cinema, and the form factor is dying in the smart phone age.  Indeed, Marvel itself has been just about the one last enduring ticket sales powerhouse - and I bet Disney has long anticipated, and is now starting to see the demographic beginnings of a downturn.

I think Disney may actually literally know that the MCU is losing steam, and likewise that this generally coincides with the end of cinema.

Thus, the business strategy has to go compete in the streaming services arena.  The nature of that world is highly competitive, and I wouldn't be surprised if the endgame for it is having to buy Disney streaming from an ISP.  That is, it's not going to be free internet, go to the website, pay the fee.  It will be: pay $40 a month to the cable company for Disney+.

Obviously, Disney+ will be an on demand powerhouse, and will probably produce broad content for many demographics.

If this is the plan, then Disney has to push its consumer base into its platform in order to have a decisive advantage in this arena.  This means more or less killing the MCU in cinemas (a soft decline).  There's a tightrope here of still having tentpole films that perform, but also letting the signal get out that things aren't how they used to be.

Also, the politics is more likely to play well for streaming early adopters, and is the right demographic to get the low-hanging fruit which Netflix, Amazon, and Hulu all also are fighting for.

&amp;#x200B;

Thus, the Marvel news.  Disney is killing the MCU in order to win the war for streaming.  They're converting the franchise to the MSU (Marvel Streaming Universe).  This inherently is more B/C-actor driven, short serials that are low risk (a half dozen or fewer episodes) and can easily be cancelled.  Sort of like the comic book format.",movies,1566512111,allNamesTaken2000,12,0,True,2019-08-22

Please help me find a the name of a movie I saw 20 years ago before I go insane,"Okay so this has been bothering me off and on for at least the last 10 years and probably violates rule 3 of this sub but sometimes your mental health is more important than made up internet rules. There was a movie I saw as a kid that's been stuck in my head the same way you remember a dream a few hours after you wake up, like weird, fuzzy stills and random phrases. The snippets I recall are so vague and blurry that I'd never be able to get a decent google result, but it just dawned on me if anyone can fill in the blanks it might be r/movies. 

&amp;#x200B;

I think I saw this movie sometime before the age of ten by way of wandering into the living room when someone else was watching TV. Why it's the one that chose to fog my brain for decades to come I have no clue, but if someone can please help me find it I'd greatly appreciate the return to sanity. Below are the details I remember.

&amp;#x200B;

1. I think it would've been from the mid-80's to mid-90's, there was a very Stand By Me or Sandlot type vibe, i.e. story with a young boy main character and his adult version serving as the narrator.
2. There was a scene (flashback?) that showed a guy lifting the porch of a house by himself with the narrator talking about how strong the guy is (I think this was from the same movie, idk man)
3. There's a scene where the main character (young boy) and his dad go fishing, they find a honey hole and get swarmed by other fisherman. The narrator says something along the lines of ""men to a sinkhole"" or ""moths to a flame"" as all the other fishermen close in.
4. Something about tops(?), like the spinning kind(?), or dreidels? I think the kids played with tops. I want to say there's a scene where they're playing with tops in the street and one falls down into the storm drain.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm still not sure entirely if this is a real movie I saw or a chicken pox induced hallucination experienced by my grade school self, but there's enough times that I've zoned out at my desk at work thinking ""What the f\*\*\* was that movie?"" that it's time to seek professional help.",movies,1563854167,TakeErParise,11,1,True,2019-07-22

Terrifer Review: A Horrifyingly Bad Experience,"Horror as a genre is a bit like coffee, the cream usually rises to the top. But for every good horror film, that means you have a deluge of shit directly underneath. Such is the case with this film, which was one of the first films listed in Netflix's Horror category, but perhaps is more uncomfortable than scare. I started it expecting nothing more than just a shitty Saw knockoff, which, to be fair is what it is. It is also an exercise in terrible script writing and acting, although not that I can blame the actors for trying to make some of the most insane lines read normally. The script sounds as if it was written by a schizophrenic drug addict who is trying his best to translate his incomprehensible nightmares to the sliver screen. He is unsuccessful. The story follows a cast of forgettable charachters as they try their best to escape from a killer clown. The clown is the best written character in the movie, because he does not utter a single line in the film. There are, of course, no character arcs in this film, as the plot only exists as an excuse to indulge in gore porn. The best I can say for this film is that the visual effects and some of the cinematography were good for a lower-budget film.

"One of my favorite shots of all time - Arrival (Bradford Young, Cinematography; Denis Villeneuve, Directing)","One of my favorite shots of the movie, and of all time! This is just a still, but I like everything about this. Once Adams turns the TV on, she enters center frame. She covers a student in the middle, to balance the shot with 3 on each side of her. I really like how subtle she is with her head movements. You can really see her character taking in the unbelievable information. 

The shot is a long one too, but the perfect length. I clocked it at 33 seconds. The blue tone from the TV shining on Adams compliments the dry orange of the classroom behind her. Even the curve of the desks brings to mind the curve of the hospital hallway from the prologue. I think it represents the curving of Adams' character's perception of time. Finally, the shot is very dark. It creates a contrast to the pure white interior of the pod later in the movie, showing how here,Adams is in the dark, but is later shown the light. 

Not that is matters too much, but for those interested, both Villeneuve and Young were nominated for Oscars, but lost to Damien Chezelle and Linus Sandgren of La La Land.

Are lasting Iconic moments of cinema still being made? Or has that era passed forever?,"From the original **Planet of the Apes** (1968), there are at least two moments that seem forever burned into our collective consciousness. The ""Take your stinking paws off me you damn dirty ape"" line, and that last scene on the beach.

I saw the first two installments of the the rebooted series, and they were pretty good, but I don't remember any standout moments or lines that match or surpass the recognition value of the ones mentioned above in the '68 film.

The MCU has given us dozens of mind blowing recreations of comic book iconography, but it all kind of runs together after awhile and because of the proliferation of such scenes it's difficult to imagine that 50 years from now any of it will stand out in popular culture the way  stuff like ""I am Spartacus"" or even ""I'm Batman"" have managed (at some level) to do.

This is not a slight to the MCU or any of the mega popular IPs of today, it just seems like that's the way it is now thanks to the sheer volume of product being put out, and to some degree the redundancy inherent in franchises and reboots and re-makes.

I know redditors are special folk who can endlessly quote scenes from **The Good Guys** (etc.) but for the public at large it just seems like most things just run together like one tent pole replacing another weekend after summer weekend ad infinitum.

Is that just the way things are now? **I'm referring only to films made since 2010**, I know there's been lots of awesome things put out, but anything that will endure in the public mind for 50 years or more? Or has that era just passed?",movies,1563859547,MattelJones,62,0,True,2019-07-23

He can't be white because he rules an African kingdom

Wakanda is a nation with magic vibration absorbing metal and Sci-Fi spearweapons, It already isn't realistic to begin with, also Black Panther was white https://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/T%27Challa_(Earth-200505) https://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Wha...Huh%3F_Vol_1_1 https://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Panther#Alternate_Reality_Versions https://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Black_Panther

Because minorities are underrepresented and white people are over represented

‚ÄúThere are not that many black and Asians so we have to change the races of white characters‚Äù, This argument falls apart when Black Panther/Crazy Rich Asians has an entire Black/Asian cast and like two white dudes, Secondly Hollywood‚Äôs putting plenty of Chinese actors to appeal to Chinese box office(huge market FYI), Instead of race bending characters why don‚Äôt you just make original characters?, If you were gonna make Flash Thompson such a deviation from the original one don‚Äôt even call him Flash Thompson, Call him Tom Jackson or something else, You seriously can't complain that a film‚Äôs cast isn‚Äôt ‚Äúdiverse‚Äù or praise it for having black female lesbians because then instead thinking ‚ÄúHow do I make a good movie‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow do I stay faithful to the source material‚Äù film makers are gonna go ‚ÄúHow do I shove this Vietnamese chick in the story‚Äù or ‚ÄúHow do I change the characters and story to appease SJWs,Lastly, Isn‚Äôt it racist if you purposely choose to not to accept audition from white actors?

"I thought Midsommar was the best film I've seen this year, and maybe longer-- anyone else?","I was absolutely *floored* by this film. It seems many reviews are applauding the setting but lamenting that the film ""devolves"" into gore and dismemberment-- I even saw one review calling Aster ""sadistic"" and unable to keep his dipravity out of the film (lol). I personally feel that the ""Gore"" is an incredibly important part of both the meaning and setting of the film-- the consistent theme of dehumanizing the human body not only reinforces the anxiety of a primitive place that is incompatible with our modern view of himan life, it also mirrors the theme of the pain of loss, relationships ending, realizing that what you thought you had was untrue, etc.... In other words the gore was in no sense for shock value, besides perhaps a couple of scenes I can think of.

Regardless, I thought the movie was absolutely wonderful beyond just a ""horror"" experience-- I'd liken the feeling it left me with to The Shining or Rosemarys Baby. A horror movie in form, but the absolutely unhinged unsettled feeling it gave me shouldn't be limited to that often belittling label.",movies,1563882919,ThrowawayFargoND,105,54,True,2019-07-23

**Filler for 300 characters:**

In October 2012, Star Wars creator George Lucas sold his production company Lucasfilm, and with it the Star Wars franchise, to The Walt Disney Company. Disney announced a new trilogy of Star Wars films.[41] J. J. Abrams was named director of the first episode in the trilogy, The Force Awakens, in January 2013.[42][43] In June 2014, director Rian Johnson was reported to be in talks to write and direct its sequel, Episode VIII, and to write a treatment for the third film, Episode IX, with Ram Bergman producing both films.[44][45] Johnson confirmed in August 2014 that he would direct Episode VIII.[46] In September, filmmaker Terry Gilliam asked Johnson about what it felt like to take over something made famous by another filmmaker. Johnson responded:

I'm just starting into it, but so far, honestly, it's the most fun I've ever had writing. It's just joyous. But also for me personally, I grew up not just watching those movies but playing with those toys, so as a little kid, the first movies I was making in my head were set in this world. A big part of it is that direct connection, almost like an automatic jacking back into childhood in a weird way. But I don't know, ask me again in a few years and we'll be able to talk about that.[47]


Writer-director Rian Johnson
The story begins immediately after the last scene of The Force Awakens.[35] Johnson had his story group watch films such as Twelve O'Clock High, The Bridge on the River Kwai, Gunga Din, Three Outlaw Samurai, Sahara, and Letter Never Sent for inspiration while developing ideas.[35][48] He felt it was difficult to work on the film while The Force Awakens was being finished.[35]

In December 2015, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy said, ""we haven't mapped out every single detail [of the sequel trilogy] yet"", and that Abrams was collaborating with Johnson and that Johnson would in turn work with (then) Episode IX director Colin Trevorrow to ensure a smooth transition.[49] Abrams is an executive producer along with Jason McGatlin and Tom Karnowski.[50] Lucasfilm announced the film's title, Star Wars: The Last Jedi, on January 23, 2017.[51]

During production, Hamill expressed disagreement with the direction his character was taken, finding the character's more disillusioned status to be contradictory to his previous optimism.[52] Hamill later said that he regretted making his initial misgivings public and compared his disagreements to clashes he had with George Lucas during the filming of Return of the Jedi.[52]",movies,1563885067,HaIo_Reach,0,1,True,2019-07-23

Top 3 superhero films?,"What's your top 3 superhero films? not necessarily your favourite but the best overall.

I'd say best to least:

1) Spider-Man 2

2) The Dark Knight

3) The Winter Soldier

Yeah, The Dark Knight isn't #1 for once.

The Dark Knight is amazing, the realism and story are near perfect and obviously Heath Ledger's Joker is literally on of the best villains period. The Winter Soldier has probably the best story out of the 3 with great pacing and it's realistic tone, also the action is amazing and the acting is superb. Spider-Man has a great protagonist, a great villain; Doc Ock does rival the Joker IMO, it has amazing character arcs and the action...the action is literally perfect, the train scene says it all, still the best action scene in any superhero film to date IMO. It's definitely the best Spider-Man film ever.

And the directors are easily some of the best of their kind: Sam Raimi, Christopher Nolan and The Russo Brothers do know how to make good films don't they?

An issue w/Spiderman Far From Home and the future of the MCU [spoilers],"Let me open by saying I think the MCU, overall, is just a ton of fun. I was a comic book fan growing up, and just watching the reverence with which they treat the content is amazing.

My son and I saw FFH and it brought to light, for me, one issue that I think the MCU needs to deal with a bit more thoroughly: ""world ending events"".

Part of what makes Spidey work so well as a character is, for the most part, he really acts as your friendly neighborhood etc. Many of his storylines could spell disaster for him, his loved ones, NYC, etc. Rarely do they span much bigger than that.

When Mysterio is first introduced in FFH he's fighting the Elementals, which supposedly had destroyed his Earth. When Spidey hears this, he's the first to say ""shouldn't we call Captain Marvel"" (amidst other dialogue, which I apologize if I don't have exactly accurate), and he's told not to invoke her name. While in retrospect understanding this was Talos, this is a fair reaction. BUT...

If we considered the Elementals as truly having world-ending potential, which at that point in the storyline everybody *must* assume it, I am baffled at the reactions here. How would that *not* be important enough to bring in Marvel, or basically EVERYONE they could find? 

To be fair Kevin Feige does an absolutely phenomenal job covering these plot points over the long term, and we'll likely discover over the next few movies that she, Dr Strange, Thor, and everyone else who *might* be able to help were off world or doing something of critical importance at the exact same time. BUT, I think the movie treated it too lightly. Shouldn't Talos-Nick have called up Fury at *this* moment to escalate a little bit? Were *all* the rest of the ""support staff"" comfortable thinking this Mysterio guy and the web-slinger were going to be sufficient to take down a monster that, fairly recently, destroyed an entire planet - and not any planet - but an actual EARTH?

I think the story would've worked just a little better and been a little tighter had the Elementals been more ""locally devastating"" - like if Venice and Prague were at risk, ok, Mysterio &amp; Spidey are sufficient. But by casting the problem as world-ending I think it is playing too fast and casual with major events in the MCU. The stakes went SO high during Infinity War/Endgame, but I am concerned the movies will lose a lot of their charm and fun if they are a never-ending series of Earth-ending-crises.

Would love to hear others' thoughts on this.",movies,1563890255,dart_catcher,24,3,True,2019-07-23

The Pessimistic Evolution of the HTTYD Franchise,"HTTYD1: Don't judge a fire breathing book by its cover. Dragons and people can absolutely get along. Even someone who's hated dragons all their life can change their mind.

HTTYD2: A bit of nuance. Some people are unrepentant one-armed assholes. Their desire for supremecy means they will never want to get along. But! Hiding yourself away like Hiccup's Mom means you end up missing a lot. Minds like Kit Harrington's can still be changed.

HTTYD3: The world is a terrible place. It'd all be much better if we stopped trying to get along. You live over there, I'll live over here. Maybe one day future generations will be more accepting, but right now it's pointless to try.

Kind of a bummer ending really. The movies get more pessimistic as they go, losing all the idealism they once had. Of course, this could parallel growing up and getting more cynical towards the world with age, but it just feels wrong that these animated family movies are giving up hope. Especially since there isn't any real ""Hidden World"" where people can live seperately without any discrimination.

Disney/Marvel is good for cinema and if you disagree you're just being a contrarian,"While DC and everything else that competes with the Marvel Cinematic Universe is drowning in failure the MCU is king and that's a good thing. Endgame was probably the riskiest movie in the history of main stream cinema and we got it to the biggest movie in the world. That's a win for bold artistic choices in movies and just because its Disney you can't say it is not.

Marvel is winning and now theres no debate and it will never change by the looks of it. They have the main stream appeal and everybody is always on their side because they are constantly great. They earned that! People always say that it is bad that Disney has so much movies but why is that when they are better then all the other imitators? It's not Disney's fault they make great movies.

I know that sounds off putting but it's true and most of us know this and my point is that this movie on this big a scale is good for cinema. The movie chains would close if it was not for the Disney films so how can you be against it? 


So many toxic people on here with so many bias comments trying to say these movies are bad even though Marvel were the underdogs and they proved every one wrong 

Disney winning this big with the MCU feels great and frankly if you disagree I'm going to assume you're a contrarian hating on the most biggest film company and you're trying to seem smart. If you would have said 10 years ago that they made a movie about a tree and a raccoon and it made over a billion people would not believe you because that is such a high risk but Kevin Feige and Disney did it.

"""Underrated"" Korean Films I Highly Recommend","Hello! I've seen many posts that recommend Korean films, and while a lot of them are excellent, I feel they mention the same movies over and over again. To change things up a bit, I've made a list of ""underrated"" Korean films for you guys to consider checking out. Now, when I say ""underrated,"" I mean Korean films that are ""undervalued"" in some ways. They could be films that aren't known by many people, or they could be well-known in Korea but not as popular elsewhere.

The recommendations will be in the following format:

Title of Film - Will also include director and year of release.

Accessibility - Some of these films are mainstream. Some of them are arthouse. I'll label each film's accessibility with ""low,"" ""medium,"" or ""high,"" ""high"" meaning many of you will find something to like about it (mainstream) and ""low"" meaning you won't like it that much if independent/arthouse/old cinema isn't your thing.

Availability - I'll label each film's availability with ""low,"" ""medium,"" or ""high,"" ""high"" meaning it's available on many streaming sites and ""low"" meaning you might have to ""look"" for it in a certain way.

Why you should watch it - A few words explaining why each film is worth your time.

Without further ado, here's a list of ""underrated"" Korean films I highly recommend:

---

1987: When the Day Comes (Jang Joon-hwan, 2017)

Accessibility - High

Availability - High (Prime Video)

Why you should watch it - Politically and, more importantly, emotionally charged, 1987 offers a gripping story based on true events, bolstered by an A-list ensemble cast including Ha Jung-woo (The Handmaiden, The Chaser) and Kim Yoon-seok (The Chaser, The Yellow Sea).

---

Aimless Bullet (Yu Hyun-mok, 1961)

Accessibility - Medium

Availability - High (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfxIfK8ThFc)

Why you should watch it - Considered as one of the best films ever made, Aimless Bullet is the quintessential melodrama of the Golden Age of Korean cinema.

---

Arahan (Ryoo Seung-wan, 2004)

Accessibility - High

Availability - Medium (Tubi TV)

Why you should watch it - It's like a martial arts film and a superhero film combined into one.

---

Asura: The City of Madness (Kim Sung-soo, 2016)

Accessibility - High

Availability - High (Netflix)

Why you should watch it - Over-the-top Korean crime drama. If you're into pulpy crime thrillers, you're in for a treat.

---

Bitter, Sweet, Seoul (Park Chan-wook and Park Chan-kyong, 2014)

Accessibility - Medium

Availability - High (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1X5N679noM)

Why you should watch it - 1) Park Chan-wook. 2) From amateur clips to more professional ones, the film‚Äôs collection of hundreds of videos is as varied and dynamic as the city it's documenting. If you‚Äôre interested in finding out what the real Seoul is all about, Bitter, Sweet, Seoul is for you.

---

Bleak Night (Yoon Sung-hyun, 2010)

Accessibility - Medium

Availability - Medium (Tubi TV)

Why you should watch it - To me, Bleak Night captures teenage angst and discontent in an exceptional way that many other similar films should strive for.

---

Breathless (Yang Ik-june, 2008)

Accessibility - Medium

Availability - Medium (YouTube)

Why you should watch it - Many Korean gangster films are hyper-stylized and unrealistic. Breathless isn't one of them.

---

Children‚Ä¶ (Lee Gyu-man, 2011)

Accessibility - High

Availability - Low

Why you should watch it - If you're into tearjerkers, you'll like this film. I'm generally not a fan of K-Drama-like films, but Children has a lot of interesting things to say about fictional and non-fictional storytelling.

---

Christmas in August (Hur Jin-ho, 1998)

Accessibility - High

Availability - Medium (YouTube)

Why you should watch it - This is a K-Drama-like romance with a measured, nuanced approach in storytelling.

---

The City of Violence (Ryoo Seung-wan, 2006)

Accessibility - High

Availability - Low

Why you should watch it - The City of Violence is one of those films that makes me happy not only because the film itself is fun but also because everyone involved seems to have so much fun being a part of it.

---


Declaration of Fools (Lee Jang-ho, 1984)

Accessibility - Medium

Availability - High (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4djhhewVJg)

Why you should watch it - One of my favorites. The best way to describe Declaration of Fools is that it's like an idiosyncratic Buster Keaton/Charlie Chaplin comedy that's part silent and part talkie.

---

The Fortress (Hwang Dong-hyuk, 2017)

Accessibility - Medium

Availability - Medium (YouTube)

Why you should watch it - One of my favorites. Honestly one of the best historical dramas that came out of Korea in recent years. Is it better to die in dignity or to live in shame? Lee Byung-hun (I Saw the Devil, A Bittersweet Life), Kim Yoon-seok, and Park Hae-il (Memories of Murder, The Host) give some of their best performances. The Fortress is also beautifully shot and scored.

Availability - High (Prime Video)

The Last Witness (Lee Doo-yong, 1980)

Accessibility - Medium

Availability - Low

Why you should watch it - One of my favorites. During an interview at Cannes, Park Chan-wook was asked if there were films other than Vertigo that influenced him at the beginning of his career. One of the films Park mentions is The Last Witness, a sprawling crime epic that embarks on one of the darkest stories ever told in Korean cinema.

---

Little Forest (Yim Soon-rye, 2018)

Accessibility - High

Availability - Medium (Prime Video)

Why you should watch it - Director Yim Soon-rye once stated in an interview that she had wanted to ""produce a low budget movie to offer this soothing and healing tool to the young generation in Korea."" Little Forest is a feel-good movie that's relaxing to experience from start to finish.

---

Mandala (Im Kwon-taek, 1981)

Accessibility - Low

Availability - High (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztXiqXgMV4s)

Why you should watch it - A lot of religious/spiritual films tend to end up as repetitious sermons that lead to nowhere. Mandala is one of those rare films you'll think long after you finish watching it. Also, it's beautifully shot and directed, and Ahn Sung-ki is phenomenal as always.

---

The Merciless (Byun Sung-hyun, 2017)

Accessibility - High

Availability - Low

Why you should watch it - The Merciless is one of the finest examples of Korean neo-noir, Korean crime thrillers that relish in violence and style. The story may not be anything extraordinary but it's the way it's executed that makes it so engaging.

---

Midnight Runners (Kim Joo-hwan, 2017)

Accessibility - High

Availability - Low

Why you should watch it - I don't think there are many buddy cop Korean films that are as fun as Midnight Runners. To my surprise, the action's also well choreographed.

My Dear Enemy (Lee Yoon-ki, 2008)

Accessibility - Medium

Availability - Low

Why you should watch it - One of my favorites. It amazes me that Lee Yoon-ki, with the help of talented actors like Jeon Do-yeon and Ha Jung-woo, is able to skillfully characterize the people inhabiting his worlds with things as small as simple gestures and careful expressions. Drama is maintained at an intimate level, as it never reaches the melodramatic highs that the majority of traditional romances have grown accustomed to. While the premise may sound uneventful, the story is both unconventional and deceptively simple; rarely has a film this unassuming be so emotionally dense without losing its modesty, its charm, or its subtlety. Hee-soo's frustrations, annoyances, and bemusements, along with her constant attempts at suppressing them, are seamlessly integrated with Byoung-woon's charming, unwavering optimism. All of this feels, oddly enough, painfully soothing. My kind of comfy film.

Save the Green Planet! (Jang Joon-hwan, 2003)

Accessibility - Medium

Why you should watch it - Wildly and effortlessly oscillates between tones, genres, shots, scenes, music, sounds, characters, stories, and virtually everything else that goes into filmmaking. Completely insane and unpredictable, yet everything is somehow cohesive and deeply heartfelt. Might end up as one of my favorites.

Sopyonje (Im Kwon-taek, 1993)

Accessibility - Low

Availability - High (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdjwD4jW4XY)

Why you should watch it - One of my favorites. Sopyonje is a western and feminine style of the pansori epic chant. The art of sopyonje is the major source of grief that destroys the pansori family throughout their years as wandering performers, yet its invigorating drumming and chants ultimately sustain them. The wonderful thing about this film is that it argues for the necessity of preserving and retaining culture; to recognize the responsibility one has to preserve a culture at risk of obscurity.

---

Spider Forest (Song Il-gon, 2004)

Korean Films I Highly Recommend,"Hello! I've seen many posts that recommend Korean films, and while a lot of them are excellent, I feel they mention the same movies over and over again. To change things up a bit, I've made a list of Korean films that aren't as well-known as the usual recommendations like Oldboy or Memories of Murder. These are Korean films that are ""undervalued"" in some ways. They could be films that aren't known by many people, or they could be well-known in Korea but not as popular elsewhere.

The recommendations will be in the following format:

Title of Film - Will also include director and year of release.

Accessibility - Some of these films are mainstream. Some of them are arthouse. I'll label each film's accessibility with ""low,"" ""medium,"" or ""high,"" ""high"" meaning many of you will find something to like about it (mainstream) and ""low"" meaning you won't like it that much if independent/arthouse/old cinema isn't your thing.

Availability - I'll label each film's availability with ""low,"" ""medium,"" or ""high,"" ""high"" meaning it's available on many streaming sites and ""low"" meaning you might have to ""look"" for it in a certain way.

Why you should watch it - A few words explaining why each film is worth your time.

Without further ado, here's a list of Korean films I highly recommend:

---

Availability - High (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K4djhhewVJg)

Why are they below ground for years just copying what people on the surface are doing when they seemingly have free will.

Why is there such a massive difference between Reddit/Critic opinions vs the audience reaction when it comes to these Disney live action remakes?,"Aladdin and Lion King have now both been incredibly well received by the audience but if you read Reddit or the critic scores you would think that they are bad movies that deserve 1 star ratings. Its weird, people I talk to in real life enjoy the new remakes in the same way they enjoy Marvel movies - they are good/fun entertainment where you don't have to think too hard. But on Reddit the comments are majority negative.

For example:

* Audience rating for Aladdin: 94%  RT
* Critic rating: 55% RT
* IMDB rating: 7.2
* Incredibly successful Box office run

* Audience rating Lion King : 89% RT
* Critic Rating : 52 % RT
* IMDB Rating: 7.2
* Incredibly successful box office opening weekend


Some of the top comments from the r/movies release thread:

* Mufasa falling off the cliff legit looked like the wheelchair kid from Mac and Me.
* During the flashback where Scar told Simba he pushed Mufasa off the cliff, that slow-mo zoom out of Simba yelling ""NOOOO"" was horrible. Looked like someone had just discovered special effects on windows movie maker...
* Whoever rewrote Be Prepared should be ashamed of themselves. It was horrible.
* Nothing takes you out of a movie quicker than a DJ Khaled song
* Did anyone else notice the part where they like sped up the frames for Aladdin and Jasmine moving through the city?
* I was mostly upset that when Jafar wished to be a sorcerer he didn't deliver it like in the animated version, that line delivery always stuck with me: ""I want to be the most powerful sorcerer...in the WOOORRRRLLLLDDDD!""

Help me name this found footage horror movie?,"Hi guys.

&amp;#x200B;

This is a movie I haven't for the life of me been able to re-find, for the longest time!

I watched it some few years ago I wanna say, and the title etc., just have slipped my mind ever since..

&amp;#x200B;

Details (although hazy and some of them probably inaccurate and mixed up with other similar movies):

&amp;#x200B;

\- The genre is found footage.

\- The theme is demonic possession.

\- The main character somewhat (physically, appearance-wise) resembles the actor, Rupert Evans.

\- Pretty sure it's an indie movie / lesser known movie.  
\- It's ***not*** The Possession of Michael King (2014), although my movie in question is somewhat similar in themes.

\- I remember something like this: the main character think himself possessed by something malicious, and has to (or just personally wants to) film himself, and record the happenings on and around him. He records himself in his own house, and I recall that at some point, he is lying on a table, and starts floating, while being under some sort of a trance / possessed state.

\- These details might be from an/other movie/s entirely, but I also recall something about his basement, which is accessible from one of those old trap doors with a big door/gate located on the outside of his house. I also vaguely recall something about a television in said basement, turning on by itself. Also, I think that the main character speaks to someone; either a psychologist or a detective, which I believe is female, and he/she doubts the main character, which is (could be) why he starts filming and documenting himself and these occurrences, I wanna say.

&amp;#x200B;

That is about all I can remember. Hope it helps, and thanks in advance for any help you guys can dish out! :-)",movies,1563909681,Scrancher,0,1,True,2019-07-23

Movie suggestions - Many stories of different people interconnected *at the exact same time period*,"Since my time travel movie post was very helpful, I figure I'll ask another question.

&amp;#x200B;

I really don't know how to describe this type of movie. I think the best example of this is the movie 11:14.

&amp;#x200B;

Basically you see the stories of many different characters \*during the exact same time period\* and then as you see more character's stories you see connections between them and previous stories (like ""oh, THAT's what that was"" and ""that's how that got there""). 

&amp;#x200B;

An example without giving away too much of the movie, in 11:14 there was a point of view of a bunch of young teenagers throwing random crap out of the window. Next point of view was the store employees, and in that scene, you see the same teenagers coming into the store to buy the random crap that they would throw out the window in their scene.

&amp;#x200B;

I also love disjointed and nonlinear storylines/multiple points of view/different people coming together, etc movies like 21 Grams and Crash, but this is slightly different and more specific.

&amp;#x200B;

Any movies like that out there?

Anyone think Frozen 2 has a shot at being truly amazing?,"The trailers for the movie have been phenomenal. I remember watching the first one and loved the snippet we got from the teaser. But stayed skeptical because it is a teaser. But the newest trailer looks even better. It looks dark, mysterious and magical. It looks like it could be a knock it out of the park Disney hit. 

I think the thing that looks best to me is the tone. I love how it really seems to be challenging these characters and have such a darker tone. Obviously this is all relatively speaking. I don't expect a Disney film to mortify me or anything. But if it can keep the tone from the trailers I think it can be something really special and I just hope they don't cheapen it all for the actual film. I thought the first movie had an amazing first act but sadly was mostly mediocre for act 2 and 3 only slightly saved by the climax of the movie where Anna and Elsa reunite.

Buzz saying ‚ÄúWell,Bonnie‚Äôs going to grow up someday‚Äù and implying when that day comes they will be together again and that while they will suffer hardship being away from each other for years that he and the others will be there for Bonnie but that they have a plan for after that would have been a nice bow that ties everything up.

Best Pixar movie of the 2010s?,"In honour of Toy Story 4 being the last Pixar movie to be released this decade, what has been your favourite Pixar movie of the last 10 years, and why?

9. Coco
10. Incredibles 2
11. Toy Story 4

For me, putting Toy Story aside for now, it has to be Coco. Simply due to my low expectations going in, and the way the film grabbed my heart and took it on a ride from start to end. It's sweet. It's relevant.

Independent Movies Query,"I always wondered this and hopefully someone can help this make sense in my head. 

I know that a movie is an independent film when it‚Äôs made out of the confines of a major film production company. However, I wanted to know when a movie is distributed by a major company is it still considered independent? 

So for example if a film is produced by BBC Films but distributed by Dream works.  Would it still be considered ‚Äúindependent‚Äù 


Also why does a film company that specializes in both production and distribution have other distributors involve on the film ? I‚Äôm assuming this is to get the film to reach a larger audience? Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. I‚Äôm jut trying to figure it out.  Or I guess because it takes a lot to make a movie.  

So does the person who want to make the movie go to BBC Films and say hey I want to make this movie are you interested and can you help me? And then BBC agrees and also gets other production companies involved to raise the money instead of putting up all the money themselves ? 

Also if a movie is distributed by a distribution company that distributes worldwide, why does it also have distributors that only distributes in a specific area (e.i UK or North America)  seeing that the other distribution company can distribute it worldwide ? 

If they can get those big distribution companies to distribute the film why not ask them to produce it in the first place ? Would it be because major film studios are usually reluctant to take on the ideas that some filmmakers want to do because independent production companies usually take risks and support filmmakers with innovative ideas? But by them distributing the film it‚Äôs kind of the same thing. At least slightly so it‚Äôs confusing to me. 

I also know that some production companies have like ‚Äúsister‚Äù companies. For example how Warner Brothers have subsidiaries like Castle Rock Entertainment, New Line Cinema etc.  Why is that? I would think since warner brother is a production company that they would have companies under them that are distribution only or something but castle rock is also a production company. What are the purpose of having these subsidiaries? 

If someone could just walk me through the whole process so it makes sense in my head if you have time that would be really great.",movies,1561262040,Pink-Mcflurry,4,1,True,2019-06-22

Child's Play 2019,"So Child's Play. For a reboot of a beloved series, I have to say, I loved it. I am by no means a Chucky fan, but I kind of like the different route they went with the killer doll. For one, the relationship between Andy and Chucky here is actually genuine instead of manipulation. That just makes the moments where Chucky's malfunctioning comes into play surprisingly sad. You actually have moments where you feel bad for Chucky because here, he was the way he was because a disgruntled worker removed the safety features from him in an act of spite towards his boss. 

&amp;#x200B;

There are scenes that were suspenseful and the kills were pretty imaginative my favorite one being when Chucky makes mince meat out of Karen's boyfriend (who had a family already mind you) with a lawnmower, and then wraps his head around a watermelon and gives it to Andy as a present. The worst of the gore is censored, but the kills were regardless memorable. As was the final act. Mark Hamill does a good job as Chucky and goes an entirely different route here that differentiates him from Brad Dourif's Chucky. In the 2019 film, Chucky starts off as initially curious and is later driven to protect his owner through violent means. It really also serves as a small commentary on how much control technology has over our lives. 

&amp;#x200B;

The actor who played Andy Barclay does a good job at playing the conflicted owner of the Buddi doll who slowly realizes that his doll was developing murderous tendencies. The actress that played Karen...was fine, but the relationship felt more of a big sister/little brother one. Yes, the film explains why this may seem to be the case, but I admit it's a minor nitpick. As for anything else...it's a film about a killer AI doll going on a killer spree. That's it. It's nothing Oscar-worthy, but you shouldn't go in expecting something grand. It's a call back to all of the classic slasher movies of the 80s and the soundtrack was also the best part of the film IMO. Really love how they reimagined the ending theme to the 1988 film.",movies,1561267273,Robinsonaustin,2,3,True,2019-06-23

Weird little nitpicks you can't help but notice in movies,"Are there any weird little details that you just can't help but notice in a movie?

Everyone complained about Black Widow not getting a funeral with Tony in Avengers Endgame and, I agree, that was bullshit. But that was actually a pretty significant narrative flaw, I wouldn't call it a nitpick. Gamora not being there is pretty weird, how small of a nitpick it is, though, is debatable. What IS something nitpicky I couldn't help but notice is that, when we see The Guardians, Rocket is standing on a stump. Why is he standing on a stump? Sure he's standing on tables or chairs throughout most of the movie but that's usually when he's talking to or looking at people. But here he's not talking to anyone, he's looking down at the ground, he's not trying to get anyone's attention, why is it necessary for him to stand on a stump? He really has to feel taller than he is at a funeral? Even for Rocket, that seems petty.

Also I'm not sure how small a detail this is but I find it weird how, in The Greatest Showman, the movie films the tall guy when we first meet him in a way that say ""OMG look how tall he is"" and, on the opposite spectrum when it comes to height, is usually filming Charles/Tom/Whatever the dwarf's name is in a way that says ""OMG look how tiny he is""! Now I know the movie is set during a time where most people didn't know about dwarfism or weren't aware that people that tall existed so you could argue the movie was just portraying the normal characters attitudes towards those people's looks. But the movie never really questions or criticizes that attitude, the movie just kinda films them like that and then moves on to the next scene. It ends up feeling like they are actually asking us to be amazed by the existence of dwarfs or extremely tall people despite the fact that, y'know, dwarfs have existed in pop culture for decades now thanks to the likes of Wizard of Oz, Willy Wonka, Austin Powers, and a little show called, oh right, Game of Thrones. Or, on the opposite side, there's a little sport called Basketball that frequently hires people around the tall guy's height.

Speaking of dwarfs in movies, it's weird that, in Moulin Rouge, one of the extras is an actual dwarf yet they then hired John Leguizamo to play a dwarf. If they were fine with having an actual dwarf be one of the extras, why didn't they just get another dwarf to play John Leguizamo's part considering the character is supposed to be a dwarf?

Films that just cannot suspend your disbelief?,"I just watched Jurassic Park (2018) yesterday and while it was a bit of dumb fun, I was not able to enjoy it fully becuase of the reason why i never watched a Jurassic Park film before - the fact that some thought that it was a good idea to make dinosaurs real, regardless of how they manage to make it believable through gene editing. 

What do they do once the dinosaurs escape their cages or even attack each other? What do they do if the dinosaurs somehow attack each other? How will they avoid the dinosaurs from reproducing to avoid further dinosaurs in the future? How will they feed all the dinosaurs without risking damaging or unbalancing the entire ecosystem or without making an entire species extinct?

I feel the same way of having trouble to suspend my disbelief in other dumb fun films like superhero films. For some reason that I cannot explain, seeing the superheroes in their uniforms/costumes in comic books seem to work well esepcially with how the art style is made to make the character appear unique (like Batman's dark suit that blends in with the gritty atmosphere of Gotham or Spiderman's blue and red fits well with the more colourful aesthetic of New York). But seeing some of the characters on screen (with a few exceptions like Iron Man) just like damn silly to me like Christian Bale's suit (who cleverly likes to hide in the shadows and avoid human contact to make it look like he is some monster and avoid making it obvious that he is a man in a suit or how Captain America in the 21st century looks like he is wearing a suit of armour than a costume) or some of the TV series of both Marvel and DC having shows with superheroes in their suits.

Patrick in 'Gone Baby Gone' is a terrible person and a hypocrite,"obviously spoilers below but the movie is from 2007.....

&amp;#x200B;

Saw this movie again now, so its been more than a decade, and had forgotten some of the twists. I was surprised how much I disliked Patrick McKenzie.

&amp;#x200B;

He's a catholic, so its no real surprise he's a hypocrite.

&amp;#x200B;

He absolutely made the wrong decision. And whats more, he made it for himself. He did it so he could feel superior and tell himself he was doing the 'right thing'. The end of the movie makes it pretty clear he knows he's fucked up, nothing has changed, and Amanda will never be happy.

&amp;#x200B;

This is someone who has no problem justifying murdering someone in cold blood just because he feels like it. We get a token scene where he gets to show off his 'shame' but of course he won't think about turning himself in. But anyone else who tries to do something, which btw every single character says is the right thing to do, that Patrick doesn't like, well he's totally justified in whatever he wants to do. This is how religions justify their crimes.

Hardcore Henry,"Just watched for the 1st time. Please debunk or tell me what you think, I'm probably over analyzing.

I noticed during the brothel scene, with junkie jimmy and nervous jimmy, there is a transition between the two clones and Henry is left alone with the group of nice female companions. As Henry's losing the last of his power, he starts going in and out of what is one of the very few non-childhood memory he has throughout the movie.

He's got Estelle on top of him, and she is  sucking on left thumb, and we get to see the full tattoo sleeve on that arm, before he gets the new one put on in the beginning.I'm pretty sure there is no memory planting in this movie, just erasing and blocking.

I found it plausible that Henry might have just wanted to have that memory/daydream. The dude did think he was in love, and was in a room full of prostitutes; plus it's not like he got many breathers to sit down to think. 

The vision was slightly distorted though, looked like they were banging in a car. It coulda be a number of sceneries, but it seemed specific.

Very minor in the grand scheme of things; but the vision, the full tattoo, the panties (the ones Akan were holding on the monitor screen towards the end, right after Jimmy's death) that (kinda) match the top she wore in the vision, even the final heli scene screamed ex-girlfriend reunion to me. 

My little theory is Henry boned Estelle before all this. Or maybe the whore was fucking all the soldiers pre-amnesia. It'd be cool to think Henry had 1 Up on Akan before all this tho.",movies,1561280455,woonan,0,0,True,2019-06-23
I found The Perks of Being a Wallflower... pretty underwhelming and anticlimactic,"I‚Äôm sure this is an unpopular opinion, and I‚Äôm willing to accept the downvotes, but I gotta get this one off my chest.

The Perks of Being a Wallflower has literally shown up on every single thread about ‚Äútearjerkers‚Äù so tonight I decided to give it a try...

I want my time back...

Nothing about it gave me even a sense of emotion. The score was pretty decent and the plot and shooting of the film was good, but, it just didn‚Äôt do anything for me.

Instead I was met with... a regular teenage coming of age story? Literally the whole time I was waiting for someone to die or kill themselves, but it turns out the dude just had some suppressed memories he was having trouble dealing with.

I want to note, that I DO sympathize with victims of childhood trauma, I just don‚Äôt see how they just threw it here into the mix. It literally could have been left out of the film and the movie and message would have still been the same... but

I'm excited for the next two although I'm not sure how they can surpass the last one.

What made the original Andrew Fleming teen Horror so unforgettable was that they had a group of four girls with distinct personalities and actresses who could act. Fairuza Balk stole the film as Nancy, her Goth punk edge style mixed with her anti-social, self-loathing personality made her into a villain you either feared or pitied but you couldn't take your eyes away from. Then you had Robin Tunney, Neve Campbell (you could tell she had a future with how good she was as Bonnie) and Rachel True. The chemistry between the four girls rang true, I was truly invested in their bond and I was sad to see it break due to their thirst for power. 

The Craft was tense, suspenseful but it was also an insightful exploration of teenage life as the four outsider girls are seduced then shamed and bullied either for their scars or skin color or being slut-shamed.

"Help, I did not like Toy Story 4 and it feels very lonely","SPOILERS ‚Äî let me start by saying I adore the first three toy story movies. I think they‚Äôre a perfect trilogy with a heartbreaking though apt ending. So I, like many, was only cautiously optimistic about TS4. Fourth instalments of most any series are usually bloat, but Pixar‚Äôs never failed with Toy Story.

I was actually quite at peace with 4 for most of the viewing. I saw in another thread someone refer to this instalment as ‚Äúepisodic,‚Äù and I think that‚Äôs accurate; it felt smaller and lower-stakes for some reason (maybe the Andy of it all), but I was okay with that. The early flashback sequence where Bo is taken away got me teary. That part felt like the TS I love. 

Flash forward and little to no time has passed since part 3. Woody feels excluded, which we‚Äôve already explored with him. Forky comes along and provides a lot of good laughs, not to mention a pretty poignant example of what it feels like to experience an identity crisis - which I guess is ultimately the film‚Äôs main theme. Woody also is grappling with finding his purpose, now a toy owned by a kid who doesn‚Äôt play with him. I can appreciate he‚Äôs looking for a new lease on life.

But I just can‚Äôt condone an ending where Woody never gets played with again. For four movies, he‚Äôs been all about the kid. And I‚Äôm supposed to be charmed that he spends the rest of his days in the pits of a carnival, with a girlfriend who‚Äôs been inconsequential to the series, while meanwhile his voicebox is being used by some doll who gutted him (and we‚Äôre supposed to feel sympathy for her?), never to fall-with-style again? Never to have another adventure with Buzz, who by the way was a secondary character in this movie and was dumbed down to the point where he was learning all over again that he‚Äôs a toy.

I‚Äôm glad most people enjoyed this. I wanted to enjoy it also. The ending disappointed me like almost no movie ever has. It‚Äôs one thing that he leaves the gang. But it felt like a fundamental abandonment of the ideals of Woody for his story to conclude with his back sewn up and no kid to make happy.

The facility pops up on Google maps when I search for 'Sqaush' but I can't find any photos of the courts or any mentioning of any leagues/box ladders going on there.

What movie scene is consistently misunderstood?,"In Force Awakens the movie goes out of it's way to show how powerful Chewbacca's bowcaster is. Han comments on it and later borrows it. [It is shown to blast two stormtroopers off their feet with ease.](https://gfycat.com/heavyimpolitedrake-force-awakens-bowcaster-bowcaster-firepower)

**Aside** I always thought Han should have commented it was a new or upgraded weapon since Chewie has had the 
bowcaster for awhile. 

Kylo gets hit with the bowcaster before:
*Sprinting out past Rey and Finn
*Force throwing Rey into a tree
*Fighting Finn
*Fighting Rey

Throughout the whole fight Kylo is beating his bleeding wound in order to keep himself pumped. 

**The message some people take away** OMG Kylo lost to an amateur. 

**The message they should have taken** Holy shit can you believe Kylo was still able to do all that after being hit with the bowcaster (the weapon the film went out of it's way to show was super powerful)

"S.M.A.R.T. Chase, the Orlando Bloom movie, maybe it‚Äôs time to rethink dubbing.","They must of wrestled with what to do with the language in this movie. It appears to be produced by a mainland Chinese film company, attempting to draw in an English speaking audience by having Orlando Bloom star in what‚Äôs basically a Chinese movie. They did a similar thing with The Great Wall, starring Matt Damon. 

The issue they run Into is that these stars don‚Äôt speak Mandarin or Cantonese, and the cast is forced to speak English, and because this is forced it‚Äôs awkward and stilted as hell. The Warrior, TV series, handled this well, I thought, as the Asian actors were bilingual. 

It seemed like Bloom was falling apart as the unworkability of this premise moved forward. I‚Äôm guessing that dubbing tech must have gotten better by now so that you wouldn‚Äôt be able to tell that it‚Äôs dubbed. They should have just made the film fully Chinese and dubbed Orlando Bloom‚Äôs lines.

What have been the worst comic book movies you've ever seen?,"Batman Forever was one of the worst. Michael Keaton was replaced with Val Kilmer who looked way too boyish and pretty and then you had the bat suit with nipples and what looked like a thong. So weird at the time. And Chris O'Donnel was just annoying as Robin and I thought he was too old. And I never understood why Nicole Kidman wasn't playing Poison Ivy when she looked so much like her, at least in the poster. And I couldn't stand Jim Carrey, always played the same manic clown in every movie he was in. Including this. And Tommy Lee Jones as Two Face? Over it. 


Red Sonja. This was so bad that even Ahnold hates it. From the super obnoxious Asian kid (Ernie Reyes Jr.) to Brigitte Nielsen's shitty acting to the godawful dialogue to the ridiculous villains including poor Sandahl Bergman who went from being Valeria to a Lesbian queen. Never did I think I'd ever see a movie where Ahnold gave the best performance. And the special effects looked cheap. Even for that era. 

X-Men: The Last Stand. How do you make a Dark Phoenix movie where Dark Phoenix is a supporting character? It was boring, by the numbers, over-stuffed and poorly directed. It felt very rushed and some characters are weirdly underused. Rogue was a lead character in X-Men and X2 yet in Last Stand she's barely in the movie which is odd considering her arc was connected to the mutant cure.",movies,1561302515,Ricardo_Rochetone,68,3,True,2019-06-23

Now I‚Äôm wondering whether to try Brawl in Cell Block 99. Is it a good movie that happens to have some violence? Or is it a thin excuse to get ultra violent? Obviously a prison movie lends itself to more gruesomeness than a western.

One nifty idea that would have made ANNA (2019) a better movie,"Okay so one of the complaints about Anna is the frequent jumps and timeline title cards, and they‚Äôre admittedly clunky. It comes across as over-explainy, and like they didn‚Äôt have faith in the story they were telling. Hell, One of the top comments in the discussion thread is this:

5 years later

3 years earlier

6 months earlier

2 months later

4 minutes earlier

9 years later

2 days earlier. 

So my idea on how to fix ANNA is to simply remove those title cards entirely. Make the movie hard to follow, and force us to rely on our wits, memories, and context clues. 
  
We would have to trace Anna‚Äôs outfits and disguises to be able to track what was really happening, and the disjointed non-chronological structure would reward repeated viewings instead of just spoon-feeding us everything. It would be like a kind of hot spy Primer.   

  
Movie Studios would never go for it because the confusion might affect the dollar return, but I think it would be a better movie in the long run. Maybe somebody could do a fan-edit removing the timeline cards and show it to somebody who hasn‚Äôt seen it, and get their take.

I think people nowadays get lost in the minutia and are missing a lot of the big picture.,"At the expense of the over film. My wife and I watched Robin Hood last night with Taron Egerton, even though everyone said it was horrible (we had enjoyed him in the Kingsman and Rocketman) so why not. If anything he will be charming and entertaining. And by no means was this the best movie ever, and at best is was a retelling of Batman. (or is Batman a retelling of Robin Hood - I don't know) but it was quite fun and enjoyable. It was a popcorn movie with action and wit. Now granted, all the characters weren't very developed, but how they are portrayed in the movie was quite new and interesting. I think what I am saying is that people are forgetting to have fun in movies. To go and watch Big Monsters battle Big Robots or Jedi nights or Superheroes trying to take down the evil Empire and not just sit back and enjoy the spectacle for what it is, I think is an injustice to a lot of movies.

How were the tapes put together in the V/H/S horror films?,"I recently rewatched V/H/S 1 and will be rewatching 2 soon. I know that since it's a horror movie, it's necessary for the context to be a bit blurry and focus more on the aspect of the unknown - and I love that about VHS. But realistically, how would they be put together?

&amp;#x200B;

In the first one, I can imagine that the old guy has seen some shit in his life and wants to learn the truth that is out there, so he pays attention to any reports of strange events he reads about online or hears about on the radio/News/whatever. So he shows up in these places and recovers anything that has been recorded (there is even evidence he cuts through the footages). It's the only thing that makes sense to me.

&amp;#x200B;

But for two, things get way more complicated. This movie's tapes are found in the house of a missing student. How did that happen? Was he related to the old man from the first movie? Has *he* seen some crazy things in his life? Otherwise, it was all staged and taped, and the thugs/the couple came across them thinking they're real, and the old guy is insane.

I loved the new characters forky was a standout, but ducky and bunny were so funny. Gabby gabby was a great villain, and the ending was great.

Chernobyl sequel: Bhopal disaster,"If there was ever a disaster worthy of a Chernobyl-like movie, it's the Bhopal disaster.  Some call it the ""world's worst industrial accident"".  Leaks were found at a Union Carbide pesticide plant in India and instead of dealing with it workers went on a 12am tea break.  Then they told the people of Bhopal the leak had been fixed and turned off the public alarm, while workers fled away from the town, upwind.

""Calls to the UCIL plant by police between 1:25 and 2:10 a.m. gave assurances twice that ""everything is OK"", and on the last attempt made, ""we don't know what has happened, sir"".""

""The initial effects of exposure were coughing, severe eye irritation and a feeling of suffocation, burning in the respiratory tract, blepharospasm, breathlessness, stomach pains and vomiting. People awakened by these symptoms fled away from the plant. Those who ran inhaled more than those who had a vehicle to ride. Owing to their height, children and other people of shorter stature inhaled higher concentrations, as methyl isocyanate gas is approximately twice as dense as air...

Thousands of people had died by the following morning. Primary causes of deaths were choking, reflexogenic circulatory collapse and pulmonary oedema.""

""The government of Madhya Pradesh confirmed a total of 3,787 deaths related to the gas release.

Later, the affected area was expanded to include 700,000 citizens. A government affidavit in 2006 stated the leak caused 558,125 injuries including 38,478 temporary partial injuries and approximately 3,900 severely and permanently disabling injuries.""

Union Carbide ended up paying a 470 million dollar fine and 7 executive were given 2 year prison sentences and $100,000 in fines but we're released on bail and never spent a day in jail.

Any weird disgusting sexual stories that happened in the theaters?,"When I went to see who framed roger rabbit (this was a local showing they played at kid's night at my local theater back in 2016), there was a young couple that was sitting in front of me and next to a family with a daughter. When Jessica Rabbit first showed up, I heard moaning from that couple as well as a zipper unzipped. All of I sudden, I heard the mother yell at the couple saying this was a public theater with kids and that they can't do it in the theater. The woman then got angry and stated that they can do whatever they want. More shouting (with profanity from the woman about how she can have sex in the theater) from both of them and then the movie stopped.

Help finding a movie,"Hi, I need help finding the title of a movie. But here¬¥s the catch, It's been so long since I saw it, and haven¬¥t had any luck in my search, I now doubt it even existed, or is pieced from different movies.

This comes from a distant memory of a tv screening, of a mid to low budget movie (stargate sg1 quality of film). So the release date could range from the 80's to late 90's.

What I remember the most is a scene in the third act, where the heros racing some kind of tank (in my mind the tank's design is close to Metal Slug tanks) in some kind of desert, and one of the heros has to climb and get into the ""tank"". Inside there's a screen, and the hero has to disable the vehicle. This vehicle has some kind of AI, because I remember an exchange about a relative/mentor of the hero being the creator or a technician to the vehicle¬¥s AI.  


What bums me out and has kept me from talking from this movie to many people, is that this well could be a distant memory of a mismatch of 80's and 90's clich√©s. Like I mashed up several movies.",movies,1561317825,must4n6,7,0,True,2019-06-23

If you recall the scene below and I think it constitutes one of the trailers for the movie, please let me know the name.

Two older guys are riding in the backseat of a car. One of the guys seems to be of some importance but not positive. Perhaps a high figure in organized crime. The other guy has been in prison recently or just out and the conversation is about how everything is much more secure these days. Surveillance cameras, alarm systems and whatnot. The conversation is about some possible future heist.

2 Jokers (Twins) exist in The Dark Knight,"Heath Ledger played the role of 2 Jokers in The Dark Knight.
In a standard deck, there are usually two Jokers.
Only Christopher Nolan, Johnathan Nolan, and Heath Ledger were the only ones in on this secret
The 2 Jokers in a Deck of Cards and it was all to be revealed in The Dark Knight Returns but due to Heath's passing the World never knew the truth in revealing his Ace in the Hole was his Twin Brother.
Both Jokers are ex-Special Forces and Twins.

For the sake of my argument, I'd like to introduce the 2 Jokers,
One Joker specializes in Explosives Ordinance Disposal. Which we shall call ""EOD Joker""
The Other Joker is Military Intelligence. Which we shall call ""MI Joker"" Both are very proficient Special Forces Operatives.

In the first scene, during the bank heist, The henchman asks Why do they call him the ""Joker"" and argue that ""he thinks he can sit this one out""
Where did they get the Bronco? Who supplied the Weapons and Ammunition? from MI Joker, while the Bank Heist was carried out by EOD Joker. Who supplied the Transportation? It was MI Joker.

In Regards to the origin of the Scars

Military Intelligence Joker states it was his father who was a Drinker and before executing Gamble
While EOD Joker tells Rachel his scars come from his wife, getting into deep with the Loan Sharks, at Harvey Dent's fundraiser at Bruce Wayne Penthouse.

While Military Intelligence Joker tortured Brian (Batman copycat) EOD Batman was setting the explosives and mixing Ammonia Nitrate.

While Military Intelligence Joker carried out the attack in which Harvey was acting as bait, he was eventually captured and kept in Gordons Cage, While EOD Joker was wiring up Rachel and Harvey Dent. It was not Maroni's men that wired up the 2 locations, it was EOD Joker, who rigged the henchman, and the 2 locations. As an ""Inside Joke"" on his brother Military Intelligence Joker, EOD Joker switched up the locations in which Harvey and Rachel were being held.

While At the Docks, Military Intelligence Joker burns his half $6,328,000,000 of the 12.6 Billion Dollars ripped off from the Mob.
While EOD Joker is at the Gotham General Hospital rigging up the Explosives which will bring it down in one hour.
EOD Joker interrogates, Harvey and sets him free. They never state what happened to the Mob's other half this is a Major Plot Hole.

In one hour, it was not possible for Military Intelligence Joker to get across Gotham City to Gotham General. While GPD was all over town trying to find the Bombs which Joker promised to detonate if Coleman Reese was kept alive after one hour.

At the Tower, Military Intelligence switches place with EOD Joker and takes charge of the hostages. Arriving with Chechnyans Rottweilers who arrived directly from the Docks after feeding upon him. While EOD Joker switches places with MI Joker he finishes wiring up Liberty and Spirit ferries. The detonators on each of the ferries at the end were linked to the bombs on the SAME ferry, not the other ferry. Both Brothers are huge into Game Theory.

During the ‚ÄúThe battle for Gotham‚Äôs soul.‚Äù Batman saves Military Intelligence Joker, MIJ talks about his "" Ace in the Hole."" Many think it's Harvey Dent, in reality, which his brother freed from Gotham General.

EOD Joker, who has left Gotham with the remaining fortune of the Mob. Which will be utilized to create more havoc around the world and lead into The Dark Knight Returns. While Military Intelligence Joker sits in Blackgate Penitentiary awaiting for the return of his brother the True ""Ace in The Hole."" to break him out.

[SPOILERS] I have a few questions about Avengers: Engame,"So, I am going to get downvoted, but I didn't like the movie.  Like, at all.  It was very flashy, for sure.  But the pacing was excruciatingly slow.  There were a few scenes that didn't need to be in the movie at all (I'm struggling to find a reason for Cap's self-help scene to have made the final cut).  Some of the scenes, specifically with Hulk, seemed to just keep going.  Like the scene with him taking the selfie with his fans in the cafe.

But, what really gets me, is how this movie establishes rules and lays them down explicitly, and then breaks them later.  That's bad storytelling.  Really bad.  We last saw that in the last season of Game of Thrones.

Anyway, **on to my questions**:

1) How was Nebula able to randomly interface with herself?  Was that established in an earlier movie and I missed it?  It just seems pretty strange that she would have an ability to interface with herself should there ever be two of her at once.

2) How was Nebula able to interface with an Earth computer from the future?  Again, this is another questionable thing that seems to just have been added for plot.

3) How was Thanos able to get to the future?  There was only the one vial of Pym Particles that future Nebula had.  Past Nebula used it to go back to the future to meet up with the Avengers after they acquired the stones.  So how was Thanos able to travel through the quantum field to get to the future?

4) How was Thanos able to navigate the quantum field to get to the future?  Again, assuming there's a way that he was even able to shrink his ship down to go through quantum time, how was he able to navigate to precisely the place he needed to be?  The movie establishes that quantum travel is nearly impossible until Tony solves it.  They even show their travel suits taking them down the proper tunnels to arrive where they need to be.  How was Thanos able to navigate this?

5) How was Thanos able to bring an entire army with him?  Again, there was only one vial of Pym Particles, and only Thanos' ship came out of the tunnel initially.

6) They say that they needed to send all of Thanos' army back to their time to restore the timeline, but then they all just end up getting dusted?  What was the point of the sequence with Ant Man and the Wasp in the van during the big fight?

7) How did Tony get the stones off of the glove?  They couldn't do it in Infinity War when they literally had several people trying to pry the glove off to begin with.  Captain Marvel wasn't able to pry the glove off, despite being much stronger than the other Avengers.  Yet Tony was able to grab all the stones out of the glove in like 3 seconds?

8) When did Tony modify his suit to be able to hold the stones?  They had this big deal about making a special glove for the stones, but Tony's T-1000 liquid metal suit suddenly morphed to include a place for all the stones?

Sorry for this long rant, but this movie is sitting at 94% on Rotten Tomatoes and I can't figure out why.  It's the worst of the Avengers movies in terms of story and continuity.",movies,1561329109,Kn0wmad1c,33,0,True,2019-06-23

Any deep sea horror recommendations NOT involving a shark?,"I've been getting into horror lately and I'm fascinated by the deep sea. Although there are many horrors involving the ocean, it seems that almost all of them involve sharks. Sharks are scary, I get that. But it seems so uninspired everytime they release another movie about some dunces running from a shark. I'm very picky about movies and even more picky over horror movies. In general (nowadays, at least), they seem so bland and unoriginal.  I'm not hating on shark movies, I just think that they have been treated the same way The Evil Dead has. The originals were classics but they were so successful that people started using them as the basis for a horror movie and it just snowballs into this cesspool of unoriginality. Teens get stranded in cursed cabin in woods. It was original back in the 80s but now it's a trope. Same can be said for jaws. Shark fear was so successful that people kept using it.

Double Indemnity - three of the most perfectly cast rolesof all-time.,"Just re-watched this yesterday and gosh is it brilliant as ever. And even though there‚Äôs only really three prominent roles, they absolutely nailed it. Fred MacMurray portraying the dark yet ultimately rather poignant journey of the enamoured fool? Barbara Stanwyck, so alluring and so venomous often within the same scene as the definitive femme fatale? Edward G. Robinson as the closest we get to a ‚Äòhero‚Äô, the wisecracking motormouth, incredibly astute investigator who‚Äôs only blinded by his friendship.

My first movie this year is **The Reflecting Skin**, a horror movie I had not heard of until recently, but one with a title and premise that drew me in. To be honest, a horror movie that reminds me of so many autobiographical descriptions of growing up years ago. This movie contained:

* beautiful music
* beautiful cinematography
* horrific images that will linger in my mind
* a creepy mood that is enough to push this into the horror genre
* kids inflating a frog through the anus and then blowing it up with a slingshot

I am a teacher watching movies this summer that I have queued up over the last 9-10 months. 

My second movie this summer was They Shall Not Grow Old, the WW1 documentary by Peter Jackson. If you are not aware, he took hours and hours of WW1 footage and cleaned it up, added color, and also added sound.

The movie is narrated by WW1 veterans and no other connection narration exists. They talk, you listen, and the footage plays showing you what the war was like. No surprises here. It was brutal, pointless, horrific, and the effects of it were tremendous on the guys. 

One moment is one I will remember forever. A bunch of guys are walking back after a battle and one man is just looking at his hands shake. No idea what happened. He may have been on a machine gun and his hands won't stop. No idea.

If you are even somewhat interested WW1 and want to see some of what it was like, check this movie out. Great, stunning, and I *still* don't get what the whole thing was about and I don't think all the guys who fought even understood. Shame.",movies,1561338692,Mahaloth,0,2,True,2019-06-23

What surprised me was how different the two movies were and only two years apart (1989 and 1991). The first seemed like a signature 80‚Äôs movie in terms of style, and the second was very 90‚Äôs for the same reason. I don‚Äôt think I have the movie analysis pedigree to understand why they were, except I could tell that costumes made a big difference.

Summer Vacation Teacher movies #3 and #4 - Kingsman: The Secret Service and Kingsman: The Golden Circle,"[Teacher on break, all the movies I've watched on my own the past few years.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ppsGgMEZzZheEn6629cFoaKb0LMxDGgBT7oR1sVw3tE/edit#gid=0)

I saw the first Kingsman when it was released, but I found that I did not remember it well enough. I had not seen the sequel at all, a gap in my viewing history.

**Kingsman: The Secret Service** - A good, but not quite great action and comedy movie. And I mean that for both genres. Not a great action movie, but a good one. Not a great comedy movie, but a good one.

The church scene gets a lot of attention and it is a highlight, but I do find that the digital blood splatters are distracting in this sequence. And I'm not nitpicky about these. I get that movies use digital blood splatters quite often today. I just found that it was distracting.

I like this movie, but have no huge fond memories of it. It feels like it should stand out more than it does for me. On paper, this is my kind of movie. In reality, it was trying to do a lot and did not fully succeed.

**Kingsman: The Golden Circle**

A much improved sequel, in my opinion. OK, so much improved is pushing it, but I did like this movie more than the original. If the first movie was packed with content, this movie went even further. 

I feel like this movie had more action sequences than almost any movie I've seen(Mad Max 4 has to be the top). Still, this movie went action-to-action-to-action from beginning to end and most of it worked.

Anyway, I would recommend both movies, but neither enter the top level of movies for me. Fun movies, worth a rental or stream. I rather doubt many will want to buy them outright.",movies,1561339551,Mahaloth,0,0,True,2019-06-23
I unfortunately believe it's time we as an audience start to no longer consumer superhero movies and demand movies no longer make them even if they are successful,"As a hardcore comic fan it pains me to say this but I think it's time for actual fans of comics to start reacting negatively to superhero movies publicly. I think it's time we start boycotting it or avoiding it all together. It's something taht needs to happen for the protection of the comic book industry. First of all movies are not translating to comic sales as sales are dying in the industry. Secondly we have reached a point in movies where people are waiting to have their expectations subverted rather than having their expectations met. This is a sign that people are tired of the genre. We have movies like Brightburn or The Boys show or all these other properties that are now trying to depict the superheroes as villains because people are bored with the superhero genre. 

I believe the words of Green Goblin is the most important quote of all time in the history of movies ""The only thing people love more than a hero is to see a hero fall"". 

And it appears we are moving towards that, where we are no longer cheering for the heroes as much over the villains, look at Thanos. People were actively cheering genocide because it became a more interesting, enthralling, and engaging storyline rather than your run of the mill 'superhero wins' movie. I mean look at the divisive nature of Endgame how half the people hated it and half the people loved it. And the reason for that was because people weren't cheering for the heroes, except for nostalgia.

We have had comics for about 50-100 years. And people have heard the stories. So much so we don't even have to tell the origin story in Superman/Batman movies anymore. They've been rebooted 7 times each. We need to stop going to see these movies. We need to start speaking up that in order to save comics we have to abandon the movies as an audience. 

The only way this can happen is with your help. It's time for you to speak to people you know. Talk to everyone. We need to band together to help save comic book movies from themselves. Otherwise Disney/WB are going to milk their characters til they are an emaciated cow with no hope of giving anymore milk. 

If you care about these characters then speak up. Say you want different movies. Get influencers to say they want something different. Don't just sit back SPEAK UP.",movies,1561339615,myansweris2deep4u,61,0,True,2019-06-23

Just had a funny-bad experience seeing Aladdin.,"Note: This is not actually about the movie per se, and there were no spoilers here.

About 10 minutes from the end of the movie, just as everything is wrapping up and settling down, right before the final pivotal moment plays, the sound cuts out. A few seconds later, the generic Cinemark advertisement audio starts playing. Everyone in the audience still sees the end of the movie, but it's overladen with just junk noise.

It kinda destroyed all the wonder and excitement of the ending, but, and it definitely sucked, but at least it's a *little* funny. Right?

Well, it would have been if it hadn't taken the theater until the credits stopped rolling to fix the mistake. During the process of them attempting to do so, the lights went up and then back down about five times, and we skipped around the final scenes of the movie for a good few minutes.

Like I said, totally ruined the tension of the ending. But hey, it's a funny story, right? A funny-bad story, but still.",movies,1558669121,JagoKestral,7,0,True,2019-05-23

The Predator is actually one of the best comedies I've seen in a while!,"I just got around to watching it because I'm a die hard predator fan and good God. Was it awful. I couldn't stop from laughing at it. After the first introduction to ""fuck your pussy"" I lost it. So many characters were out of place. Just over all, bad actors for their roles in relation to the attempt of a serious tone of the movie. 

The damn dog getting a lobotomy was my favorite though. ""you shot it stupid"" was a great explanation!

I stopped watching it as a predator movie and started seeing it as a high budget b movie comedy. 

Overall I thought it was horrible in relation to  the predator universe. On it's own it's a good joke film like ""Teeth"".

What genres do you think should be explored/dissected more?,"Lately I've thinking a lot about the John Wick series and how it brilliantly dissects the typical action hero . Traditionally, we have the ""action hero"" in most movies who is this hardened badass or underdog who all the bad guys underestimate but possesses these barely realistic abilities to kill anyone with ease and escape impossible situations most of the time using simple items like guns or a ""*pencil""* and is relatively left unscathed by the end. John Wick proposes the inherent fear this kind of invulnerable person would bring as if the bad guys are actually aware they are in an action movie and the star of the show is pissed off at them. Some of the bad guys have even the utmost respect and are just happy to fight him. 

Movies like Watchmen/Kickass and Cabin of the Woods did this similarly with the superhero genre and horror genre respectively. A lot of genres have implications within their tropes that are far too often left ignored. What other genres/tropes do you think have more potential to be explored and dissected?

The Most Deceptive Movie Trailer You've Ever Seen?,"Been browsing all the various upcoming trailer talk on the other posts and this made me remember and think about deceptive movie trailers.

You  know, where they cut and work the trailer to make a movie look much better than it actually is, a different genre than it actually is, or worse of all, showcasing scenes that aren't even in the movie at all.

So I was wondering, what do you think are some of the most deceptive trailers there are?  


One that comes to mind that I fondly remember was the trailer for the 2011 movie, Sucker Punch.. Seeing that movie trailer in theaters, looked so bad ass, so full of action.. looked like some martial arts sci-fi action flick with a touch of noir and fantasy.. However in reality.. it was a movie about a woman committed to a mental institution, and all the action sequences in this trailer only really make up the minority of the movie and were the main character's delusions during her escape. A real let down, as the movie that the trailer depicted looked like it could have been a great action sci-fi movie, however in reality it was a confusing let down.

ALIEN at 40: Ridley Scott's perfect movie about a perfect organism," 

*Processing img 32outq3qn5031...*

&amp;#x200B;

There‚Äôs nothing to say about [Alien](https://thefilmera.com/2019/05/20/alien-revisiting-the-classic-on-its-40th-anniversary/) that hasn‚Äôt already been said, but that doesn‚Äôt stop it from feeling anything less than magnificent upon every rewatch. Ripley is one of the defining women of cinema, and the film‚Äôs perfectly executed battle to the death will forever be held as the gold standard. Every part of the film is alive ‚Äì the goo drips, blood burns through floors, sweat beads trickle down foreheads, and with every death, there is an evolution. And although Scott‚Äôs celebration of all things icky might be full of tension, it‚Äôs certainly not bleak or cynical. Although Ripley goes through much more after this chapter closes, I wouldn‚Äôt blame anyone for simply enjoying the hopeful and peaceful ending she gets in this, once self-contained, film. Because the serenity and rest afforded once the fight is won is just as rewarding as any of the precise and beautiful moments of terror *Alien provides*. And for anyone wondering, the 4k release does a fantastic job of allowing viewers to experience all of this in a better fashion than ever before.",movies,1558702001,Iceman2913,0,1,True,2019-05-24

Avengers Endgame and Into The Spider-Verse comparison,"There are more than few similarities with Endgame and Spider-Verse...

* **A superhero coping with depression and becoming fat**: Thor becoming fat like Peter B. Parker (following Aunt May's death and his divorce).
* **A reunion of a superhero and their maternal figure of family who dies soon and knows that this version of superhero is the alternate dimension/timeline version**: Thor and Frigga's (who will die) reunion, where Frigga immediately figures out that this Thor is from the future alternate timeline like Peter B. Parker's reunion with Aunt May, who is dead in his universe and Aunt May easily figures out that this Pete is from an alternate dimension. For bonus points, both Peter and Thor say *""bad idea, bad idea""* right before meeting their respective mother figures.
* **Spider-Man watching their idolized older hero die fighting a huge and bald villain**: Tony Stark dying in the end after fighting Thanos where Spider-Man watched him die like Miles watched Peter Parker of his universe died fighting Kingpin. Although the Spider-Man who watched the older hero died is a different person; Peter Parker in Endgame, Miles Morales in Spider-Verse.
* **Older white hero passing on his mantle to a younger black hero:** Captain America passing on his mantle to Sam Wilson and Miles Morales becoming the next Spider-Man.
* **A superhero complementing other timeline's version of him**: ""That is America's ass"" scene to Peter B. Parker who saw a billboard with blonde Peter Parker's face on it and says that this version of him looks perfect (both in terms of looks  and achievements). For bonus points, blonde Peter is voiced by another actor named Chris.
* **Someone who notices alternate version of him as been killed**: Peter B. Parker and Thanos.
* **Mirror confrontation of 2 same characters of different dimension/timeline**: Steve and Nebula getting into a fight with an alternate self of themselves like the stinger that recreates the Spider-Man pointing at Spider-Man meme.",movies,1558703254,K-J-C,0,0,True,2019-05-24

Let's Discuss Alexander (2004),"Let's Discuss Oliver Stone's *Alexander*, 2004. 

It was pretty much reviled, hated and dismissed as being too ambitious and too much of a mess when it was released. Upon initial viewing, I too, didn't care for it. I thought that while the history and mythos of Alexander the Great would be an amazing idea fully brought to the big-budget screen, and in a time when ""Sword and Sandals"" were being greenlit after the success of 2000's *Gladiator* I eagerly anticipated another epic. 

What I think Oliver Stone got wrong ultimately was three things.

1) Casting. Why Colin Farrell? He didn't fit the role. A young Christian Bale hasn't hit megastardom from 2005's *Batman Begins* yet and is just one of the leading men who could have been cast. Added to this was Angelina Jolie. This was evidently a ""Oh, she's red hot right now so let's cast her so we can sell some tickets!"" Ploy, and Stone gave her copious screen time when in reality, Olympius wasn't truly germane to Alexander the Great's history.

2) ""Family Focus"" storyline. Admittedly, Val Kilmer's raging, drunken Phillip II was an incredible performance, in my opinion. Showed that Val Kilmer had range. The movie dove entirely too deeply into the ""Court and Daggers"" of Alexander's home life, when in reality, this was unimportant to the history of the Hellenistic Conquests of Asia. Angelina Jolie's ridiculous ""Transylvanian"" accented Olympius received a ridiculous amount of unnecessary screen time, which could have been cut and devoted instead to the Siege of Tyre, or the Egypt Campaign, or the Crossing of the Hellespont. When I rewatch *Alexander Revisited: The Final Cut*, I now skip almost every scene of Angelina Jolie's, and it makes it better movie.

3) Too much story for one movie. Crucially important events such as the Gaza campaign, Egypt and the conquest of Scythia were omitted presumably in the interest of time. Alexander's campaigns were almost 11 years. That's a lot to cover in a 2.5 hour film. Should Stone have broken the story into two or even 3 movies? I think so. 

Bonus: how should Alexander the Great be tackled once again? Does it become a ""universe"" type of property where young actors are selected, and a trilogy of films are shot according to the star's ages?  Film movies every few years? Should Amazon/Netflix/Hulu do a miniseries of seasons?

"Transformers movie hurts my soul, it's a prime example of how to desecrate a source material.","I understand that this is really late, the films came out over a decade ago, and i guess no one cares anymore, but I was thinking about this last night and I just wanted to rant about it, sorry if this is the wrong place for this... 

Firstly, I just want to talk about the appeal. Transforming alien robots!! So cool right? I was 7 when the first one came out, and I loved it. I was a big fan at the time, I remember watching a lot of the cartoons. The concept is the main feature of the franchise as a whole, but it's the characters and the things they go through that keep you interested. 

 Bay does not understand this. When I watched the first film, I was in either two states of mind, one being ""omg woah look at the transformer"" or, ""can we get to the transformers pls"". I remember hating the main character, Sam. Personally, I do not find any appeal in his personality, but , not the problem. The problem is that Sam is the main character. His entire existence is a nuisance, and it goes against my entire reason to watch this film. I came to see alien robots, not people. There is no need for him to have such a central role in this franchise, and I kept on wishing he would die every time his character was in danger! I remember having this thought at 7. Simply because I was so annoyed at his mere existence, I couldn't like him. Even if his character was more likable, the screentime was excessive. 

This is my main gripe with this franchise, the lack of screen time given to the transformers. For those that have not watched any of the cartoons, they actually have personality! But you wouldn't know that, and I don't blame you. When Jazz dies in the first film, only actual fans of the franchise cared, no one else would. In the G1 continuity, it is stated that "" Jazz could be recognized by his love of music, his friendly nature, and his incredibly cool voice and disposition "". To ma boi  Michael Bay, it means he can make a sterotype. There is no logical reason for any Autobot to use that much slang. I mean they learnt english to communicate with humans, so why not just have all of them speak perfect english. 

The transformers make no sense. They are not proper characters. Not at all. That's the other main issue. In all honesty, it makes sense to give them little screen time, as they don't have any depth. You can simplify every single Autobot with one sentence, apart from Optimus.

Rachet: Oooh sam wants to SMASH!

Ironhide: Oooh look at my cannons.

Jazz: Oooh look how strong Megatron is.

Bumblebee: camero advertisement. 

Not once are we shown how they specialize in their designated role. I mean Ironhide has an extra gun. It's so apparent they exist just to showcase the toys and for the transformation sequences. That's it. This lack of realism is what ruins the films. 

Let me explain. 

Allegedly, cybertronians are a sentient race of mechanical beings. They are machines with a soul if you will. They are portrayed to have the same emotional spectrum as humans do. They have morals. So they must have other interests than fighting Decepticons right? RIGHT? Do they have hobbies? What were they doing prior to the war on Cybertron? These aliens have a conscience, so do they not get tired of fighting? I dare you to imagine any transformers as real people, it's not possible. What does Optimus want after he wins this war? 

Are the Autobots and Decpticons tired of seeing their comrades die ?  Its so easy to split up the cybertronians into two sides based on how they see other life forms. Autobots value other life, Decepticons do not. 

I understand why you would think that these are stupid questions, but there could be such a good plot if they made the cybertronians real characters that have actual motives and desires. Here is how I would write the plot of the first film. 

The Decepticons want to invade earth and turn it onto Cybertron, as they are aware that a piece of the all spark exists in earth and the Autobots want to stop them. The Decepticons move to Earth. Only after realizing what the Decepticon plan is, the Autobots are forced to follow them to prevent destruction as they value life. The Decepticons think that they are superior being as view humans as livestock. The Decepticons land on earth first. Megatron convinces all of  Earths leaders that there is a piece of the Allspark in the earth and the evil Autobots want to take it and convert the earth into Cybertron. Little known to the humans, the Decepticons are stealthily interrogating and murdering humans to find the Allspark. Insert human character, who witnesses this, maybe it's his or her family that gets interrogated, and they realize that it's all a lie. They start looking for Autobots as that character has realized who the good guys are but no one will believe them, as Decepticons are paraded around like heroes. Then the Autobots land on earth and they have actually hide in plain sight as they are wanted fugitives. 

In my opinon, this makes Megatron an actual villan, instead of a meme, and makes the final confrontation between Autobots and Decepticons a clash of ideals as much as a physical fight. 

 I want to point out the complete lack of effort dedicated to making sense. In later films we see a Samurai  transformer. He has a thick japanse accent. why? NOBODY KNOWS. All they had to say was somthing along the lines of how the country the transformer lands on affects their accent. So this samarai autobot landed in Japan, and when he connects to the internet to understand the planet he is on, he learns japanese first, and models his appearence after the warriors of the country he landed. I know there are holes in this idea, but it makes the cast more memorable. I mean it could have been a way to find international appeal, with each transformer embodying the cultural values of where they land. Its a simple way to build character. Also why does a Japanese Transformer become a buggati? Wouldn't it be cool if he became a Nissan GT-R?  Just makes things more logical. Japan have done a lot for the franchise, they make quality cartoons, better than this hot garbage. 

Speaking of diversity, where are the female transformers? *ThEy ExIst!* I'm not pulling a star wars on you, but why can't there be female transformers? Why can't transformers have relationships? If they can feel loss, why can't they feel love? I'm not asking for hot oily robot copulation, I just want the transformers be real characters. They can't have half an emotional spectrum. There could have been two Decepticons be in a relationship and one gets killed. The other loses his/her mind. I don't want the films to be political but there is potential for these robots to represent us as humans. Imagine a transformer that is gender fluid, and actually changes voice, and mannerisms and even asthetics on what gender they feel. I mean it's extreme, but it's nice to be inclusive of how varied we as induviduals can be and it would be nice to represent this. 

Also the transformations could be representive of the character. For example, an autobot who thinks organics are filthy could transfrom into a Rolls Royce, as he finds the brands elitism appealing to his personality.  Let it have a posh accent. Let it be a germaphobe. Let there be a charecter arc where he realises the value of humanity despite the filth, instead of *Howt Whrod*., and his overpowered time stopping gun...

I just want to point out, I do not care about whichever model is the love interest in these films. 

I know these films are glorified toy commercials, I know that the only motivation is the money. It's just that it I've realised what this movie franchise could have been and it makes me really sad. There could have been so much depth to this film, and it could have still been a glorified toy commercial at the same time.  I understand that these are kid freindly movies and my ideas about character are rather mature topics, but having said that, why is there always an attracive female secondary character in skimy clothes../. I could honestly go on forever about how good it could have been, but I'll stop here. I feel like i'm being completely stupid about this, but it's how I feel. Any transformers fans relating to my sadness? 

&amp;#x200B;

TLDR, I consider this franchise to be a heaping pile of trash that shits on the source material when it could have had a lot more depth.",movies,1558706429,kavvu,20,0,True,2019-05-24

Lars Von Trier and Antichrist - what does r/movies think of it?,"[While I was working on a short video about Lars Von Trier's Antichrist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPKxCmRLac) I was thinking about how this film has such a mixed response. Some people love it and it's considered a modern classic (it's even on the Criterion collection) but others hate it and criticise it for being gratuitous with its violence, depictions of graphic unsimulated sex and some even consider it misogynistic. 

Lars von Trier always tries to provoke audiences though and I find that kind of fascinating how almost each of his films seems to divide opinion. What does r/movies think of his films, specifically Antichrist? Do you love it or hate it? If you've never seen it, is it something you're interested in seeing?

Zero Effect Love and Appreciation,"I feel like nobody has seen this movie. Back when BlockBuster still rented VHS tapes I checked out some movie and when I got home I found Zero Effect in the box instead of whatever I originally wanted. It was late, so I popped it in and found what became one of my all time favorite movies. 

Bill Pullman is excellent as Daryl Zero, the worlds greatest private detective. The story is tight, it‚Äôs filled with great quotes, and it‚Äôs entirely self contained. Why doesn‚Äôt it get more love?

My favorite quote from the movie has to be:

Daryl Zero: ‚ÄúNow, a few words on looking for things. When you go looking for something specific, your chances of finding it are very bad. Because of all the things in the world, you're only looking for one of them. When you go looking for anything at all, your chances of finding it are very good. Because of all the things in the world, you're sure to find some of them.‚Äù

Possible theory in Ex-Machina,"The Jackson Pollock painting in the film is brought up once and is shown throughout the film on several occasions. Yes, Nathan explains its significance, but there‚Äôs an eerie correlation with it as well.

Jackson pollock died in a car crash.  Caleb‚Äôs parents died in a car crash, which was one of the deciding factors in him being chosen.  He had no family and thus was more easily manipulated and seduced by Ava, as he wanted a ‚Äúfamily‚Äù or someone to love.  In both the painter and Caleb, a car crash ultimately had a strong impact to their demise.  

The other factor that lead Jackson Pollock to crash was that he was strongly under the influence of alcohol.  This is related to Nathan.  Throughout the film, Nathan is shown being piss drunk and sometimes passing out.  Because of this weakness, Caleb is able to code the doors while Nathan is passed out.  This leads to Nathan‚Äôs death as well.  

Possible theory, thought it had a strange coincidence.",movies,1558714963,Furiosa_Ripley,11,20,True,2019-05-24

Help Me Remember Which Movie Theater Chain an Ident Bumper Was For,"So... sitting around the other day with a friend waxing nostalgic about happy childhood memories.

One of mine was this movie theater ident bumper, that, too me, was such a happy memory.  Going to the movies was such a big part of our group of friends.  We‚Äôd see the bumper every time, regardless of the trailers of what movie we were seeing.  It was the one thing that never changed from movie to movie.  Perhaps that‚Äôs why it is such a vivid memory for me.

It was for a major theater chain.  It was a flyover view of completely-computer generated cityscape that ended over an open air amphitheater filled with cheesy computer generated people.

We tried to find it on YouTube, but couldn‚Äôt find it.

Why Warner Brothers will never beat Marvel Studios,"Multiple jokers, A disconnected universe, hit or Miss movies all over the place. What's the point?

Hollywood has a long-standing tradition of taking something that works, making bad copies Ava and expecting the same success. Remember all the horrible Sci-Fi movies that came out after Star Wars? 

Does Warner Brothers really want a successful superhero franchise like Marvel? Just an idea, instead of trying to copy basic concepts like a shared universe, massive budgets, model-esque superheroes, an over-exaggerated special effects you actually strip down the reason why Marvel movies work, and copy that.

Warner Brothers makes about 30 movies a year, so does Disney, but Disney doesn't make Marvel movies, they leave that for Marvel Studios.

How's about a DC Studios, the focus is only on making DC movies? Find a well established producer and massive comic book nerd to run it. Hire fans to write and produce them, people who actually understand the content material and why it's so loved. 

Through all the money and Flash you want at a film, but you're never going to see any success unless you're willing to give it to the people who understand why it works.",movies,1558728060,Jimmyray81,26,0,True,2019-05-24

Looking for a film with a very specific feel.,"To those who have seen Miller‚Äôs Crossing and Barton Fink, I‚Äôm looking for a recommendation that fits the feel of the climaxes of these films. 

In MC, there is the scene where Caspar kills The Dane, while Drop is yelling his head off in the background. 

In BF, there is the scene with the wallpaper sweating, the hotel bursting into flames, and of course Goodman yelling ‚ÄúI‚Äôll show you the life of the mind.‚Äù 

These two scenes are very bizarre to me. They‚Äôre obviously very ominous in nature, but they also have these comedic, somewhat nonchalant undertones that seem like they‚Äôd counteract the ominous nature, but instead somehow contribute to it. It‚Äôs like that feel in a horror movie when the director plays some uplifting music that totally doesn‚Äôt match the horrific nature of the scene. The juxtaposition, the contradicting tones, it‚Äôs very unsettling.

My perspective on the terminator timeline,"Personally I consider them all to be cannon, continuity errors are markers of the timeline distorting. So every time judgment day is stopped the past (and the future) changes

So the time spiral goes like this;

T1-T2 happen, 

in T2 they push the date of judgment day forward, now it‚Äôs Sarah Conner chronicles and terminators from the new future begin meddling in the past due to the new sky net being a chess machine and therefor taking more strategic risky ventures into the past and creating the t-888 model terminator with coltan skeleton, a t-888 using tech she was able to re-create from the future time jumps past 1997 when Sarah dies of cancer, the inventor of sky net 2 is killed thus pushing JD up again changing the future and the past and John is thrown through time. eventually landing in 2009 where he is now 3 years ‚Äúolder‚Äù than what he should be, and Sarah has now died of cancer back in 97 due to the time travel and John is alone.

Enter skynet 3 and t3 where John is alone but skynet 3 is now the future threat and was invented by the military, skynet 3 invents t-x after the failure of t-1000 and t-888 are unable to be produced because skynet 2 couldn‚Äôt stockpile coltan before the war. T-x is killing the generals in johns army drastically changing the future but this time John and his future wife cannot stop judgment day and it happens. 

Salvation continues after T3 where John now has to fight to become the leader of the resistance due to the fact he no longer has support from the people who were killed in T3, John is treated like a joke until it‚Äôs too late and because The hand from T1 was destroyed in T2, skynet 3 builds its terminators from an emergent (but different from the one mentioned in t1) ‚Äúadvanced cyberdine‚Äù tech company than created markus, the leadership of the resistance is destroyed and John is left to take command and eventually win the war, he stands triumphantly before a tattered American flag before discovering the facility skynet 3 uses for time travel.

Enter genysis and John tried to put the plan in motion the way that Sarah (last seen in SCC) said by giving Kyle (who was saved in salvation) his moms picture and sending him back, however skynet 3 ain‚Äôt no chess robot, without his generals there to take his command and/or protect him John is converted into a terminator and sent back in time to kill his own mother attempting to successfully complete the mission that skynet 1 failed. However the remaining resistance (led by johns wife as mentioned in t-3) begins reprogramming old t-800 modes to send back to correct to future she sends back ‚Äúpops‚Äù from genysis and the terminator from t-3 (the terminator in t-2 was sent by John from the universe where he didn‚Äôt loose his generals) 

This new movie seems to take place in the version of the past where Sarah was never time jumped, basically in SCC she skipped her death so she had more time to train John but because John was thrown into the future then back between traveling skynet 2 was destroyed and replaced with skynet 3 thus causing the t-888 to never be invented causing Sarah to stay in her original timeline, presumably the future has been muddled so much that John isn‚Äôt even important or necessary to the future victory over the machines, Sarah now has to reconcile this by protecting the new mother of the new savior the same way Kyle protected her so manny years ago.",movies,1558731907,JacobAKAplayer2,6,11,True,2019-05-24

Finally sat down and watched Aquaman.,"I was completely floored by just about everything. The acting was honestly most fantastic by all the supporting characters, while I thought Jason Momona was decent I thought Amber Heard, Willem Dafoe, and Patrick Wilson stole the show. I would also like to add that the story was pretty awesome, I went in thinking that there would be a large portion of the story on the surface just because I haven't seen much other televised or cinema work focused in the ocean. The story showed so much more about the lore than I was expecting and it was all really helpful and fun to watch and they had some really amazing world building, seeing all the other kingdoms was fascinating since I don't know much about Aquaman. All the visuals made me think of Avatar, and made me wonder what Black Panther could have been if they showed the advanced civilization as they did in this movie. The writing could be a little clunky, but it didn't really take away from the movie, in my opinion, all that much. Finally, on a side note that trench dive was beautiful, but the fight scene in Sicily on the rooftops following both Mera and Aquaman made me think of adventure films to the likes of Indiana Jones or Tintin.

Before I get in to it I have to say this was clearly Lauren Cohens break into movies since Walking Dead, same with Rhonda Rousey after the terrible expendable 3, and John Malkovich is completely wasted in this as well.

My favorite part has to be the beginning. It sets Mark Wahlberg up to be this genius loner who excels at everything and is misunderstood because he is a genius and has a fun little quirks of slapping a rubber band on his wrist anytime his mind starts to lose control. Because, duh, he‚Äôs above us. He‚Äôs a genius. We don‚Äôt operate on his level. Then we get scene after scene of him speaking as fast as possible and trying to sound intimidating and clever at the same time. I imagine when he read this or came up with it, he was cumming as hard as a 12 year old boy who just discovered the internet. It is essentially the epitome of all that is Mark Wahlberg. I can‚Äôt imagine watching Shooter, Pain and Gain, or anything else because this is truly one and a half hours of Mark Wahlberg being himself with a gun. And it couldn‚Äôt be anymore boring. 

To top it off, the villain - the only real positive here due to the hand to hand combat scenes, says at the end ‚Äúsay hello to your mother‚Äù. The classic Wahlberg catchphrase. As if we weren‚Äôt treated like shit enough by having to endure this movie already, they slap us on the face yet again with the ‚ÄúLOL see we‚Äôre so clever‚Äù tag at the end. Which literally makes zero sense in the context of this movie. The joke would have been better spent on ‚ÄúThe Other Guys‚Äù. 

Anyway, watch something else, watch the fucking Postman with Costner if you have to, watch Gigli, do not indulge this garbage.",movies,1556079720,rather_be_a_hobbit,65,39,True,2019-04-24

Then when she asks about the scratches her husband claims that he had sex with her while she was sleeping and she was completely fine with it.  So that's pretty much what Roman Polanski got arrested for ten years later.

Why was Star Wars: The Last Jedi so poorly received online?,"As you many of you may be aware of, relative to its reception in the mainstream press, The Last Jedi appeared to receive an outsized and quite energetically negative reception on social media. On [Rotten Tomatoes](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/star_wars_the_last_jedi/) it has a 91% fresh rating with critics, and a 41% audience score  (aka online reviews). On YouTube, videos that offer the film praise seem to attract a [huge amount of dislikes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1VeOlIDD9o), sometimes close to 50%. Some of the film's cast members - notably [Kelly Marie Tran](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/21/movies/kelly-marie-tran.html) - complained of negative comments on their social media pages in the wake of the film's release. 

So the question is... why? I personally didn't care for TLJ, and clearly it polarized viewers to some degree. But this degree of online criticism strikes me as exceptional. Many equally bad films are released each year without stoking nearly the same level of vitriol. Michael Bay's *Transformers*, for example, are big budget movies of questionable quality, but I'm not aware of any of those films being such a flashpoint for negativity, and neither Bay nor its cast members seems to have been targeted by upset viewers. 

Was there something unique about TLJ that spurred this response? I'm all ears for theories about this phenomenon.",movies,1556082255,rowbury,14,0,True,2019-04-24

in the movie In Time. flaws of the system set up in the movie,"so in the movie people are genetically modified to stop aging at 25. a clock is placed on them that kicks in once they reach 25, if the clock reaches ZERO they die. so time is the currency.

the system is set up to ensure the rich can live forever, and some of the poor are supposed to die to prevent overpopulation.

&amp;#x200B;

the problem with this is simple. if they have the technology to modify a human to literally stop aging, than they would definitely have the technology for interstellar space travel as well as advanced Terra forming, as such the possibility of overpopulation wouldn't exist.

&amp;#x200B;

with current technology we can send a probe to mars in about 8 months. if they had the technology to alter a humans biology so effectively than we would also have the technology to populate mars and other planets in the Milky way.

&amp;#x200B;

so logically speaking everyone would stop aging at 25, and everyone would be immortal. they apparently have the ability to create limitless time on the clocks. they only limit its distribution",movies,1556083323,randell1985,8,0,True,2019-04-24

As a movie lover, I've often felt frustrated about spending hours to find a good movie. So I decided to build a movie recommendation app that would help me do the job.

Its name is Flixee, it's a Tinder-like app for movies and it's very simple to use: the apps suggests you movies one by one. You  swipe to mark if you liked that movie or not. Based on your swipes, you receive new recommendations. And the more you swipe, the more accurate it gets!

I've been working on that project for more than a year now, and I'm really excited to see what you may think of it. Give it a try and let me know!

The app is available for free for both Android ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flixee](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.flixee)) and iPhone's users ([https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flixee-movie-finder/id1202349438?mt=8](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flixee-movie-finder/id1202349438?mt=8)).

I was disappointed however to find out that the majority of them only have the American dub available as opposed to the original Mandarin dialogue.

I prefer to watch movies in their original language where possible but without spending hundreds of pounds importing the DVDs from specialist sellers I don't know if I'll be able to find them that way. 

Is there much difference between the original Mandarin dialogue and the American dub? I can just about put up with the corny American accents but would be disappointed to lose out on some of the context when re-written for an American audience.

However by definition it says a space opera is anything that often emphasizes romantic, often melodramatic adventure, set mainly or entirely in outer space, usually involving conflict between opponents possessing advanced abilities, weapons, and other technology.

Now that's a space opera but with some of those things being said...would something like The Pick of Destiny be considered an Opera (aside from not being in space)?

looking for a movie that should be around 10 years old. based in 40s 50s or 60s,"So I'm trying to remember the name of a movie that should have come out between 2010 and 2013. I only remember a few scenes. I really wanted to share it with my wife because I remember us enjoying that movie when we  were just together.  It I remember correctly the whole movie is based in the 40s,50s or in the 30s. not sure which one exacly. 

&amp;#x200B;

the scenes I remember are:

1. there was a kid that got touched by a girl who had, what I presume to be acne. but they had told him it was Coodies? or cooties? and the only way to make sure he doesn't get it from her is to hit her with his jacket over and over, while saying something in the genre of "" from where the cooties came, they shall remain""? I think it was something like that.
2. this kid who is doing a paper round throws the news paper way of targer just to have an excuse to go pick it up, in the hope of getting a peak inside the windows to see the girl he is in love with. only for the father to say something in the genre of ""thats the ""umpf"" time this week you have missed my porch, ya got a good arm kid"". or something like that. in a later scene we revisit this scene just for the girl to say her daddy gave the cash so she could pay the boy for the news papers
3. the same boy and girl as i remember from the other scenes meet together behind school to basicly make out but no one can know or something like that.

It's not much to go on, but it's all I remember so far. been looking for over a week now and can't seem to remember more than that.

Netflix Sharing Idea," 

Im sure most of us share subscription to Netflix, Hulu, Vudo, Amazon Prime , HBO GO etc and other streaming services.

If we stop and thing about it if want access to all their contract we end up paying $30-$40 in subscriptions per month.

what if we enter a subscription sharing platform or sharing app and instead of paying $30-$40 per month to access all streaming platform you only pay something like $20 to have access to 4 or more streaming services.

if by volume we can work out a deal with Netflix, hulu and HBO go and other streaming platforms to let us share subscriptions or if we can get a lot of people then they can discount their prices to from 10.99 to 7.99 or something lite that.

It works for them because they actually get paid for their content and it works for us because instead of paying 40+ in subscription we only pay 20+ or something like that

So we will create packages of streaming services for a flat fee or at a discourage prices.

Is there a film that you regret not seeing in theaters?,"One of my biggest regrets is not taking the time to go see *Blade Runner 2049* in IMAX. I think it was only there for a week or so in IMAX in my local area and I remember being preoccupied with other things and didn't take the time to go see it in that format.

Several weeks later, I eventually got around to the theater to see it (coincidentally, it was the last week it was in theaters in my area) and I loved it. I saw it in an auditorium with a decent-sized screen. It wasn't a huge auditorium, since the film was about to leave theaters, but the sound in that theater was fantastic.

I will always regret not going to see that film in a large format screening like IMAX or Dolby Cinema, but would love to if it ever returned.

Please help me find a movie about Jesus on a beach,"Alright, I know that this title sounds rather generic, but please hear me out.

&amp;#x200B;

I've been looking for this film for over 15 years. I remember seeing it in the early 2000's as a VHS recording my dad made (many) years before that. My father doesn't remember and the VHS is gone.

&amp;#x200B;

I only know the ending of the film, which ends up with Jesus resurrected and seeing that the stone closing his tomb has rolled to the side. You don't actually see him walk out, it's just the stone that is shifted. You will see him walk down a small road (foresty road) heading for a beach, where children will run up to him in joy when they spot him. As far as I can remember, at this point Jesus is wearing ""modern"" day clothing and his hair has been trimmed to a shorter haircut.

&amp;#x200B;

I honestly can't remember much more about it. I think it was a movie, and not a documentary. But in any case ""Jesus on a beach modern clothing"" doesn't help much on Google.

"Are Cap America, Iron Man &amp; Thanos the Luke SKywalker, Han Solo &amp; Darth Vader respectively of this generation?","When you look back to 2008 all the way to Endgame it's incredible how well connected the Infinity Saga has been and all the characters presented to us in a realistic non comic booky way. It's almost inconceivable that this even exists.

They turned Steve Rogers from an optimist blindly following the government to a jaded vigilante on the run and it made sense.

They turned Tony Stark from a jackass billionaire playboy to a guilt-ridden, ptsd'd, mentor &amp; father figure stretching from 9 movies.

They even turned Thanos, from a mustache twirling ""muahahaha"" bad guy who wants to date death, into a somewhat empathetic antagonist who means well in some cases but as well say ""the Road to Hell is paved with good intentions"" and ultimately his way of doing things is pretty darn villainous but he's so compelling and interesting it's hard to take your eyes off him when watching his scenes.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't felt this way since watching my New Hope for the first time on dvd with my father, I was in love with the characters and Darth Vader truly captivated me. But it wasn't really on the same level for me as it was my father because before a New Hope I saw a Phantom Menace so my perception of Star Wars at the time was ""it was alright"", I should have watched the Original Trilogy first biggest regret.

&amp;#x200B;

So back to the question I can't help but see so many parallels between these characters, do you guys agree, disagree or have different characters for these positions? 

&amp;#x200B;

Do you also think in 10-20 years we'll look back to the Infinity Saga of the MCU the same way as the Original Trilogy of Star Wars?",movies,1556133576,zakhaev1,49,0,True,2019-04-24

Attempting to explain Jordan Peele's 'Us' [Spoilers],"I wanted to find a discussion for this movie and came across [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/b3n187/just_finished_watching_us_2019_by_jordan_peele/).

To me, it seems like people are missing the entire concept of what this movie is trying to accomplish. I wanted to share my ideas about the film and maybe clear up some of the confusion.

As a first mistake, I've seen people trying to explain the events of the film as if they were occurring in a rational world. Let's start off by accepting that the world in 'Us' is pointedly *not* rational. Rather, it is a believable depiction of a world one might find in their nightmares -- a demented, meandering construction of one's subconscious. I think it helps to try imagining the events from the perspective of a person who, as a child, was traumatized from her experience a dark, confusing, frightening attraction in an amusement park. Thinking about the events from that perspective, everything comes together rather easily; everything that adult Adelaide experiences can be explained by the events from her childhood. The fact that all of this comes across to viewers as some sort of chaotic fever dream is the very beauty of the film!

I'd like to know if anyone else put things together from this perspective. I think it really allows me to appreciate some of the details of the film, which I will try explaining a bit below.

**Warning: potentially wild speculation ahead**

* Why were the Tethered so focused on the Hands Across America movement? 

 Adelaide is wearing a Hands Across America shirt, and was shown watching a commercial when she is introduced in the movie. This clearly sticks in her mind when she thinks of her traumatic experience.

* Zombie-like behavior of the Tethered

 Thriller by Michael Jackson, anyone? Her parents talk about how the music video frightened Adelaide when she selects the T-shirt as her prize.

* What's the deal with the rabbits? 

 Take one look at the theming of the attraction where Adelaide had her traumatic experience. The hidden panel to the tethered is very plainly decorated with rabbits and the camera even focuses on this to solidify this connection.

* What about the coincidences leading up to the attack from the Tethered? 

 I'm pretty sure this is some more hinting that Adelaide is having some sort of nightmare -- coincidences as a trope of dreaming.

* The secret tunnels? 

 Simple information Adelaide could have picked up and inserted into this nightmare.

* Red jumpsuits, scissors? 
 
 Individually unsettling elements -- Adelaide's imagination creating a 'scary person'.

* Doppelg√§ngers, in general? 
 
 As a lost child, seeing someone who could *almost* be a parent or guardian, and then finding them to be a stranger leaves one feeling rather betrayed.

* The final twist?

 Not totally sure on this one, but I might believe this to be some realization of Adelaide's ultimate fear; some metaphor for her post-trauma change, *blah blah blah*.",movies,1553479878,Aierou,5,0,True,2019-03-24

"Thanos was a terrible villain, and the movie was overrated as a whole","(A) Thanos is an absolute moron. He is essentially a god with his powers, yet his grand plan to deal with unsustainability is simply to just kill 50% of life. One, that's just totally arbitrary. Two, it's a monumentally stupid idea as it would only delay overpopulation by about 50 years. As an example, Earth's population doubled between 1965 and now. 

With the powers Thanos has, he could do so much more. He could terraform every planet in a ""circumstellar habitable zone"" in the galaxy if he wanted. He could use his powers to generate essentially unlimited energy. 

(B) There are way too many characters in this movie. The story just jumps around from character to character, half of whom it's like who gives a fuck about these dumbass randoms? This movie seriously lacked focus.

(C) Marvel in general just makes a bunch of generic trash movies. Horrible scripts that are popular because of their massive CGI and marketing budgets. This movie is no different, yet people act like it's such a great movie.

[TOMT][Movie] Revenge action movie,"I remember watching a movie quite a few years ago when I was a kid, and recently have been searching for its name without success. The movie begins with the protagonist (basic action movie badass white dude) leaving jail, going and picking up his muscle car, and setting out on revenge against the bad guys. 
I dont remember much, but two scenes have stayed in my memory ever since.
The first is the first guy the protagonist kills. He simply walks into and office, and sees a man sitting down in an office chair. He says his name, the guy turns around, and the main character pulls out a shotgun, and shoots him point blank in a very violent fashion.
The other, and possibly more useful, scene I remember, has to do with the protagonists past and the end of the movie. The main character has piece of metal screwed into his skull, under his skin, from a previous surgery from before the movie took place (possibly shot in the head and survived before but I'm not too sure). At the end of the film, the protagonist is standing outside, and is shot once again, in the head, by the ""main"" bad guy. The bullet bounces off the metal chunk in the protagonists head, and he survives once again, allowing himself to kill his last target and save the day.
Overall, I remember the movie being very violent and action packed, with some really cool scenes I still remember today. Hopefully this is enough to go off that someone know wtf I'm talking about. Thanks!",movies,1553495791,TyZed1356,0,1,True,2019-03-25

People overly focusing on ‚Äúplot holes‚Äù,"Anyone else growing tired of the nonstop ‚Äòcriticisms‚Äô of a movie for not holding their hand and explaining every little detail? Is it really so bad for people that a movie ending with unanswered questions is a flaw now? 

This is mainly about what I‚Äôve seen people criticize Us for but I‚Äôve seen it happen with most movies coming out today, ala A Quiet Place for example.

I don‚Äôt know, am I the only one who honestly isn‚Äôt upset when a movie doesn‚Äôt answer anything or has a plot hole or too? Movies will never be perfect, especially horror movies. There‚Äôs going to be inconsistencies, plot holes, and unanswered questions, but as long as it‚Äôs not so massively distracting it breaks the entire plot, does it really matter?

Personally, I just think it‚Äôs annoying sometimes that it feels like a movie can‚Äôt just be a movie nowadays because cinemasins had to know every detail about a character‚Äôs motive.

Criticism for film is important, don‚Äôt get me wrong, but it feels like this is ALL people focus on nowadays. Or maybe not, did people scream plot hole about not getting a scene where Michael Myers goes to the hardware store and makes the decision to steal the mask?",movies,1553496713,ratlizards,732,685,True,2019-03-25
"The prequels are trash, the sequels are shite, and the originals are overrated.","Some day Disney is going to make Star Wars 23: Revenge of Jar Jar Binks, and y'all will realize that I'm right.

Prequels (Trash) : ""I hate sand""

Sequels (Shite) : Force Awakens is a generic/boring version of A New Hope. They just copied the same exact plot, but the characters aren't nearly as good. The Last Jedi is just sloppy and dumb. Luke Skywalker suckles goat tit and the actor is washed up AF. The movie wasted 45 minutes to pointlessly shoehorn some preachy space Monte Carlo side plot. The villains are lame, and the protagonists are devoid of personality.

Originals (Overrated) : These are undeniably good movies - amazing score, great special effects for their time, good characters. However, these movies are generally considered some of the best movies of all time, but I don't think they are quite on that elite tier. These movies have some pretty big flaws (e.g. plot holes, ewoks, and Luke being a whiny bitch). They are definitely high quality entertainment that just about anybody will like, but there are better epic trilogies and franchises, plus a lot of standalone movies that are better than any given Star Wars movie.

"Movie Showerthought: Samuel L. Jackson is both Spike Lee, and Tarantino‚Äôs ‚Äúgo to‚Äù guy when it comes to their films. Spike isn‚Äôt a Tarantino fan.","I always wonder all the time how that dynamic between Spike and Samuel L. goes because Lee has gone on record (several times) and said that he thinks Tarantino exploits African Americans in his films. Meanwhile, Samuel L. Jackson has been pretty much been Tarantino‚Äôs go to guy since Pulp Fiction, and often times MAKES the Tarantino films he‚Äôs in. I remember once when he was asked about it after Lee made some comments, Jackson said something to the effect of, if not outright saying, ‚ÄúSpike needs to chill the fuck out.‚Äù Yet there has never seemed to be any bad blood between Jackson and Lee because of it. Jackson and him even appear in commercials together, and are quite good friends. I‚Äôm sure you could chalk it up to Spike just being ‚ÄúFuck it that‚Äôs my boy‚Äù and I‚Äôm sure it really is as simple as that, but I think that‚Äôs a testament to what an actor and ultimately what a necessity he is to both master filmmakers films.

"A breakdown of ""The Invention Of Lying,"" a uniquely vicious and angry movie with incoherent rules that feels like it was written by incels.","I watched Ricky Gervais‚Äô ‚ÄúThe Invention Of Lying‚Äù on Netflix tonight for the second time ever, and was really struck by how legitimately bizarre and uniquely hostile towards humanity the movie is, from every possible standpoint.  

For those who don‚Äôt know, the film takes place in a universe where people never learned to lie, and follows the story of this alternate world‚Äôs first ever liar.

Except‚Ä¶***that‚Äôs not the premise***.  Like, that‚Äôs a more or less accurate ‚Äúidea‚Äù of what the movie is, and that‚Äôs certainly what the movie intends to be, but it isn‚Äôt that, and it‚Äôs Not That in such a smugly contemptuous way that it‚Äôs kind of a mindfuck to try to process.

Let me get this out of the way right off the top: there are parts of this movie that are absolutely brilliant.  It‚Äôs funny the whole way through, and many of the scenes are extremely inventive within the premise.  The big twist of the movie, wherein Gervais‚Äô character invents religion, is a complete curveball and totally reinvigorates the movie, leading to many of its funniest moments.

&amp;#x200B;

That said, this movie is‚Ä¶unnerving.  It‚Äôs negative about the human condition in a simplistic and aggressive way that pervades every aspect of the film.  This is not a ‚Äúcinematic‚Äù movie.  This movie is profoundly ugly at every level.  

I'll try to explain.

&amp;#x200B;

It‚Äôs flatly lit in drab colours, the sets and locations are spartan and so cheap looking it breaks immersion.  Every scene is directed SO STIFFLY; almost all the establishing shots are flat or missing entirely.  The camera rarely moves or tracks characters, and we almost NEVER get real wide shots; everything feels constrained, each location we go to looks like the most boring, most featureless version of what that location could be.

Was the bland and stolid production design part of suspending the reality to match the weird rules of the world of the film?  Like no dishonesty =/= no style =/= no creativity?  Well, maybe, but it makes the movie hard to look at, and here we come to meat of our discussion:

# WHAT ARE THE RULES OF THE WORLD?

&amp;#x200B;

1- 

It is strongly implied that a kind of genetic, neurobiological change in the main character gives him the ability to lie.  This is never addressed directly, but is introduced with a disorienting CGI dive into his brain where we see electricity and glowing stuff start going on.  **So it‚Äôs not so much that lying was ‚Äúnever invented,‚Äù but rather that people in this world are biologically incapable of generating or processing dishonesty.**

&amp;#x200B;

2 - 

The nature of ‚ÄúHonesty‚Äù in this world is truly grotesque, and **bears little relation to actual honesty in real life.**  In fact, this world‚Äôs ‚Äúhonesty‚Äù seems to destructively effect basic human kindness at such a basic level it would‚Äôve made all of human history almost completely impossible.  Not only are people in this world ‚Äúhonest,‚Äù they‚Äôre also locked in constant culturally instituted open class-warfare between rich pretty people and ugly poor ones.  No one can shut their fucking mouths about anything, everyone just has to say the worst thing on their mind in an emotionless way at all times like a robot.  Almost all expressions of emotion are muted, blunt and indifferent, which seems to fly in the face of the premise.  

&amp;#x200B;

3 -

Empathy and Love play a major role here because of how conspicuous they are by their absence.  **Characters who are winners self-identify as winners and are shown to be correct, and characters who are losers self identify as losers and the movie does nothing to make us question their assessment.**  This makes characters we‚Äôre supposed to like, like Louis CK and Jonah Hill, come off bland and empty, whereas it makes characters we‚Äôre meant to LOVE, like Jennifer Garner, look like a completely psychotic, possibly unstable, image obsessed white-privilege nightmare.  

&amp;#x200B;

And we‚Äôre supposed to invest in Ricky Gervais being with her.  Because he‚Ä¶why?  Why does he deserve to be with her?  Every single interaction we see is her just openly insulting him or him lying to her and her listening with interest.  No exceptions.  There‚Äôs one where he tries to teach her compassion, but even that is couched in lies.

&amp;#x200B;

4 -

**Speaking of compassion: it doesn‚Äôt appear to exist.**  Cruelty is the baseline human attitude.  Characters are CONSTANTLY shaming each other; in fact, before the lying begins, pretty much every interaction had is cruel, hurtful or selfish in some way.  No one is nice, ever.  ^(...Because that‚Äôs what ‚Äúbeing honest‚Äù is?)  

&amp;#x200B;

I‚Äôll add, I am watching this from the perspective of a thin white man in his 30s, I cannot possibly imagine what it would be like to watch this film as a woman over 35, or and fat person.  The movie just VICIOUSLY goes after soft targets like women‚Äôs insecurity about aging and people‚Äôs insecurity about their looks or their weight, and presents these brutal and constant observations as insurmountable human truths instead of individual personal struggles experienced in extremely different unique ways across history and even in modern culture.  

The most bizarre choice and delusional choice by far is the ending, a Hollywood Loser Gets The Girl classic wherein Jennifer Garner‚Äôs character leaves Robe Lowe‚Äôs character at the altar for Ricky Gervais, despite him having ‚Äúbad genetic code‚Äù (ugliness).  

It‚Äôs presented as **True Love** winning out over Superficiality, except‚Ä¶Everything she knows about Ricky Gervais is a lie, and ***they have demonstrably have no chemistry and no real relationship.  Her relationship to him is as worthless and shallow as her relationship to the blatantly awful Rob Lowe.***

At they end, when they end up together, it feels like the movie on some level shamefully knows this: they don‚Äôt even kiss.  

The camera just sort of pans up with both of them smiling at each other.  It feels like we‚Äôre meant to be happy about this, except: Ricky Gervais‚Äô character RUINED THE ENTIRE WORLD by introducing a fallacious religion to a society that is biologically incapable of seeing through the delusion, and the relationship he‚Äôs now entering is a totally fucking empty nothing based on him wanting to fuck Jennifer Garner.  

The movie makes a big deal out of him not using the Lying to get sex from women, but at the end, he basically does exactly that in a much more sinister and insidious way.  It doesn‚Äôt feel like a commentary; it feels like it bought into its own bullshit.

This was at the height of Ricky Gervais‚Äô respect and influence in the entertainment industry in 2009, and the cast is just BIG FLEX after BIG FLEX of actors who clearly wanted to be a part of Gervais‚Äô first movie.  Many of them are essentially just cameos for one scene, but there are so many it spins your head around; Jason Bateman, Tina Fey, Edward Norton, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Louis CK, Jimmi Simpson, Jonah Hill, and that‚Äôs like not even close to covering it.

None of them, except maybe Rob Lowe in a bigger role, are used effectively.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is literally a bartender in one scene who has very few lines who just talks about wanting to grab boobs.  Many characters that seem important when they‚Äôre introduced have no character arc or pay off.

# IN SUMMATION:

Truly, the film feels like it was written by extremely clever and funny incels.  

Everything is a rigged system.  Even if you actually feel this way about the world, philosophically, the presentation here is arbitrarily angry and negative.  

Humans aren‚Äôt even presented as self-interested animals; the movie thinks it‚Äôs commenting on human nature, but deletion of emotional expression is a total straw man that turns everyone into selfish emotionless automatons existing in a compulsory superficial capitalist hell.",movies,1553500605,VankTar,193,184,True,2019-03-25

"My thoughts on America after watching Jordan Peele‚Äôs ‚ÄúUs.‚Äù *no spoilers, only like 2 not so important details from the movie which you probably already saw in the trailer‚Äù","There was a lot to take from the movie on both individual and societal levels. What stuck with me was one line from the movie when Red, the antagonist, said ‚ÄúWe are Americans.‚Äù 

This was a movie about your typical family taking a vacation. They oozed the idea of the American dream: husband and wife, two kids, vacation home; a perfect family. 
Their evil selves had a tougher, more horrifying, storyline. 

When they said they are Americans, it makes me compare the american dream versus the worst parts of this country that we, just like the protagonist family, are ignorant of, and so terrified to confront those truths. We as a country harbor many lifestyles, not all of them encompassing the ‚Äúamerican dream.‚Äù

When those truths show up in front of the faces of the privileged, we will be terrified. 

It makes me think, what does it truly mean to be an American? 

As for the movie, it was incredible and it leaves you with a lot to think about. It does it‚Äôs justice as an incredible horror movie, and the storyline itself is enough to leave you with an eerie feeling inside. The symbols and motifs will have you thinking about it for a while.

**Notable Box Office Stories**

* **Us -** It seems that despite having a title that is impossible to Google (and also to torrent in the near future) the much anticipated second feature from Jordan Peele opened to a massive #1 with $70.2M. That's the biggest opening ever for an original horror film and is the third highest horror opening overall only falling below It ($123.4M) and Halloween '18 ($76.2M).  If that wasn't enough, Is is actually the biggest opening for an original live action film since Avatar in 2009. 
* **Us (cont.)** - That's pretty damn remarkable for just the second feature from a director, let alone an original IP with a wild premise. This opening definitely speaks to where Peele is culturally as he jumped from hit sketch comedian to major influencer with Get Out's $250M box office run and eventual Oscar win. This combined with a well advertised Twilight Zone remake with Peele in the Rod Serling role as showrunner/host means the man is very present right now and people are very invested in him as a brand. It's perhaps no surprise then that Us more than doubled the $33.3M opening of Get Out, but now the question is will it maintain?
* **Us (cont.)** \- Review wise the film scored similarly good reviews to Get Out but Us scored worse on Cinemascore, a B rating to the A- of Get Out. Now it should be noted that for horror a B is actually pretty solid, as many acclaimed horror films like The VVitch and Hereditary got a C or D rating. But it does show that perhaps the more surreal and less obvious themes of Us means it's not the same kind of crowd pleaser as Get Out. And let's not forget that Get Out had incredible word of mouth, with it dropping just 15% on its second weekend and dropped less than 40% for 7 straight weeks. Already we are seeing a difference as Get Out actually gained on its first Saturday and dropped very little on Sunday while Us had drops on both of those days.
* **Us (cont.)** \- But of course we can't even consider the most drastic drop until we actually get to next weekend, although Us does face tough competition with Shazam which is coming in with excellent reviews as well. Whatever sophomore slumps this film may or may not have it's still another critical darling that far outperformed its $20M budget and if Peele continues to play in this scale he will certainly have massive control and influence for years to come. So now the question is what will be the next pronoun named horror hit after the massive success of It and Us. A remake of Them? A film version of You? My new terrifying possessive pronoun horror movie trilogy: Mine, Yours, and Ours?

"Any recommendations for movies that made effective use of CGI, special effects, set-design, and/or costume &amp; makeup to tell a story that was visually-compelling? Would like to hear why you think so too!","I'm not trying to be too strict here. So it can be any genre and the effect doesn't have to be gargantuan.

I was thinking about the original Alien (1979) because of another thread about the series in /r/movies. 

I think the reason Alien (or Jurassic Park) were so compelling in their visual spectacle and world-building was excellent set design, economy of special effects, economy of lighting, CGI and animatronics, etc.

Alien is a great example of less-is-more. Even today, 30 years later, it's the best Alien movie. Why? Because when you saw the Alien, it wasn't placed under bright light. The DP and Ridley framed the Alien in darkness and you saw it under specific circumstances and angles. 

They were working with the technological limitations of the day - but this is precisely what made the Xenomorph so scary and compelling.

To illustrate this effect even more, think about the movie 'Husk' (Kevin Smith film from a few years back) and the Justice League film.

**Husk is an example of how bad practical effects and bad lighting and PRESENTATION can undermine the creature:**

In Husk, we see the creature under bright lightning. It looks absurd and fake as heck. Really plastic looking. It's a shame too because Justin Long gave an extremely agonizing performance. 

**Justice League is an example bad CGI; an overreliance on CGI can undermine the creature:**

I don't even remember the bad guy. He looked like a video game CGI cutscene villain. Terrible. It didn't help that the story was generic af and the villain's motivations were boring.

The page is relatively new, about a month old, and it's not  building up much steam. At first I was just going to post shots from movies, but if the page got more popular I was going to start adding film recommendations, spotlighting unpopular indie films and sharing work from creators trying to get themselves seen. I've been sharing once a day at least, but if the page got more popular I'd share a lot more. The follows the page has been getting is mostly from those follow for follow people, so it's not very genuine.

Would you be interested in a subreddit dedicated to user's movie reviews?,"I enjoy writing reviews/analyses of movies I see (both in theaters and movies I catch later on streaming), but I have found that this subreddit is a little too broad to be a good place to post reviews. 

I often post mini-reviews or analyses on the official discussion, but when a movie is very popular (such as Us), the thread already has thousands of posts, so it's unlikely for people to see it. I generally find that on this sub, because it's so popular, there is a finite time period where people on this thread want to discuss a movie (basically, opening weekend) and if you miss it, you miss the chance to share your thoughts and be seen (unless the movie has a huge following on this sub, such as ""Moon"" or ""Inception""). I also don't want to flood this subreddit with my reviews, especially since that doesn't seem to be one of the main purposes of this sub. 

I think it would be cool to create a space where users have the opportunity to write their own reviews and analyses of movies they see for an audience who is interested in film criticism and discussion of movies. It could be for both new and old movies. Unlike the dedicated threads on this sub, your ideas would have a better chance of being seen. Also, as a side thought, it could also function as a place where we can help each other hone and improve our film analysis and writing skills by giving feedback and challenging each other's ideas. It would not be a place to post other people's professional movie reviews.

So can we talk about the recent commonality of the UK/London as a setting in standard American action movies?,"Pretty much the title, but I'm probably not as erudite as I thought so here we go...

So, I have heard that the UK, particularly London, has recently lowered the costs/taxes associated withthe production of film production. And, as can be expected, the moment I heard that I couldn't help but notice the implications of such a move in every film I watched there after.

This has lead to what I called ""Why is this set in England?: Syndrome"", whereby I cannot help but feel that the scenes set in the UK were incorporated into the script cus it was the cheapest option rather than the best setting for the film, and it takes me right out of the moment.

There's no real question in particular, I guess I just wanted to see if this was something that anyone else has noticed, or if anyone had any particular thoughts as to what effect this particular aspect of modern filmmaking has on the art form as a whole. 

Yeah. Bit rambly I know. But, has anyone else noticed a lot of films set in the UK recently, and has anyone got the facts/figures/and effects.

Much love.

Just for a bit of context before I go, I thought I would list all the examples I could think of.

Firstly we have American action films (which are mostly produced by/starring Tom Cruise now that I have compiled it)...

Hellboy.
London Has Fallen.
Thor: The Dark World.
Spiderman: Homecoming.

Charlie Brooker‚Äôs Dead Set,"10 years since the mini-series Dead Set aired on TV and I‚Äôm still surprised that many horror fans still haven‚Äôt seen it and being such an influential horror show of it‚Äôs time, it‚Äôs a crime not to watch it. Overall it isn‚Äôt a special show but the content of it does show a lot of what lacks in horror shows and that‚Äôs bones of realism and nothing too wimped down.

Charlie Brooker wrote this smart and risked a lot with the concept of having it be based around a sucky-reality TV but the end result was definitely something to make horror fans smile. 

The characters are typical cliche reality tv people that end up caught up in something seen in horror film while zombies are killing people outside. 

There are a lot of moments that stand out for me from the first episode all the way to its end episode. The ending that featured a lot of surprises and twists which ended the show so shockingly that it felt wrong but right at the same time. You‚Äôve definitely seen clips.

Feral(2018) has the worst protagonist ever. Thoughts?,"Hello guys! So i'm a sucker for horror horror movies, so i watch any movie even if it had a low rating. So today i saw this movie called feral. The plot was the usual small scale zombie outbreak kind so i hopped into it. Potential spoilers...

\&gt;!So 6 friends go camping into the woods, during the night one gets supposedly killed and another one is injured. They meet a guy named Talbot who invites them to his cabin, as the movie goes on you get to know that it was Talbot's son who attacked their group and he was infected with a strange virus 8 years ago and now has been infecting them too. They turn into zombie like creatures after incubation. At this point in the movie, out of 6, 2 have been completely turned (Maat and Jesse), one is on the verge of turning (Brie) and another is infected (Gina). that leaves 2 of them (Alice and Jules) uninfected including Talbot.  

&amp;#x200B;

So Alice is the protagonist in the movie and throughout the movie they point out that she likes saving lives. So when Talbot says that there's no cure for this and they have to kill Brie and Gina before they turn, shes adamant to do it and keeps threatening to kill Talbot if he tries anything. This is her talking after she has seen one of the ferals (Jesse) bite Gina. So she know what's gonna happen to them. But decides not to do anything, Brie turns and they tie her to a bed in a cellar and sedate her to stop moving. Now Gina is on the verge of turning and Talbot reminds them to kill them, as if their numbers increased they could start hunting in the civilization causing an epidemic of ferals. She still keeps saying that even if they turned they are her friends and cant kill them and wouldn't allow anyone to kill them. The very next minute after she utters these words she goes guns blazing and stats killing her 'friends'. She kills Maat and Jesse. She comes down the cellar where Talbot renders her unconscious and locks them up in the cellar. Talbot's son bites Talbot and turns him, while below Alice bashes the head of Gina who turns. Then Talbot's son breaks into the cellar where Alice distracts it and lets Jules escape, and kills him too. Talbot chases Jules and manages to scratch her before Alice kills him. Knowing that Jules is infected too, she begs Alice to kill her before turning. She refuses. Finally Jules kills herself and Alice walks away.

&amp;#x200B;

What i hated about Alice is while she knows there is no cure and she can't do anything about it, (remember Talbot tried for 8 years curing his son to no effect) she keeps insisting to let them turn and then kills them. I mean if shes ready to kill them anyway why wait until they turn? Talbot was the only human in that forest which kept his son, the only feral before the movie bound to the forest, now with him dead and Brie still a feral and tied up in the cabin there's nothing stopping her to go out of the forest and infect others. While she could kill all her other 'friends' why leave one alive? On top of it Alice is aiming to be a epidemiologist so she would've known better. If she would have listened to Talbot and kill Brie and Gina as soon as they died, Jules would've been alive, Talbot would've been alive and his son would've been the only feral again who would be bound to the forest due to Talbot. Talbot is a jerk for keeping his son alive, but i feel Alice is the bigger jerk here. In other movies i can understand for keeping an infected person around. Like for in Resident Evil there is a cure if the infection is in the initial stages so there was hope. But that was not the case here.!&lt;

&amp;#x200B;

So these were my views on the movie and the protagonist. I'd like to know the thoughts of the people who have seen the movie. Sorry for the long post and thank you!

What movie franchise will take the place of Marvel Studios' MCU?,"So, we all know it's coming. Eventually, a new big movie franchise will come to surpass the MCU. It's just a matter of when, not if. I actually got to thinking about this because on the MCU subreddit, there was a post suggesting there may never be a movie experience in our lifetimes that surpass Avengers: Endgame and the replies basically echoed this sentiment: ""If you're not around much longer after Endgame, perhaps. If you're fairly young and are around, then definitely not."" So, what will it be? We also have to remember China's basically the biggest film market now so maybe they'll produce movies even bigger than ours? Then, there's streaming so the theatrical experience may not even be a thing one day. I would say Hasbro is a good contender since they now own Power Rangers as well as Transformers and GI Joe and can make a multitude of spinoffs and crossovers in a sort of Hasbro Cinematic Universe, but Power Rangers 2017 did so-so and although there's plans for more Power Rangers - It's still unknown what its future is along with how Transformers 6 is coming. Then, there's GI Joe and a Snake Eyes movie, I think? I'm just not sure how it all seems like it ties together as part of a business plan. DCEU would obviously be the next big contender, but they've stated they're doing away with interconnected filmmaking (which I think is for the best because it makes for better content for them), so I'm not sure if that practice can beat Marvel unless the individual film series make enough bank without a cinematic universe feel. 

As of now, I never thought I'd say it, but - It seems like Pokemon may be the next big Hollywood thing. Movie insiders seem to confirm this might be the case and think about it - Pokemon is the biggest media franchise in the world. Although this means nothing in terms of movies, if Detective Pikachu does well enough - WB can start doing Detective Pikachu as a trilogy or whatever along with a main Pokemon series and spinoff movies for certain Pokemon characters. You can even follow the Marvel practice and kind of set the movies in different genres depending on the Pokemon, teaming them up with different types of human main characters. And the cool thing about Pokemon is that there's different types of the same Pokemon, so they can reuse Pokemon without a problem. Then, there's the Chinese film market, where Pokemon might do exceptionally well do to the appeal of Pokemon. And honestly, as much as I love Marvel - I fully welcome a new Hollywood juggernaut franchise to enter Hollywood in the 2020s that can at the very least rival them. I don't want Marvel and Disney to dominate my whole lifetime, y'know?

"[SPOILERS] After two viewers and reading multiple summaries, there's one thing from Us that I really can't understand","TLDR: If the original Adelaide was really the one trapped down in the tunnels, why did she still have to imitate the actions of the clone?


The film establishes a number of truths throughout. One is that while the government could clone people, they could not clone their ""souls"" and thus each clone is tethered to the original. We see through a number of scenes that the clones have to mirror the actions of the original, and this is done down in the tunnels. At no point does the film state these actions have anything to do with the tunnels themselves, just that the clone is tethered to the original.

When the clones first invade in the living, Clone Adelaide (at this point we think it's the clone, but later really learn it's the original) says that she had to mirror the actions of the one above the tunnels. For example, when the original had a c-section birth, the clone had to do it herself in the tunnel.

That's the part I don't understand. Why did, simply because they switch locations (original went to tunnel, clone went to real world) did all of the sudden the original have to start imitating the actions of the clone?



Basically:

1) We learn clones underground imitate the real above

2) A clone switches spots with an original

3) The original grows up to explain she mirrored the actions of the clone while she (the original) was underground

4) huh???

Why would the original be imitating the actions of the clone? It's established that the clones imitate the real. Why did that switch just because the original went into the tunnels? IMO that would mean the tunnels themselves have the power, but that's never mentioned or alluded to in the film so I don' think that would be correct.

\-answer your own question (I.e comment a ""plot hole"" you see people complain about, answer why it is not)

Can go as specific or general as you want. I made this thread because I think that it is important to keep an open mind and be flexible.

But no.

They cast this random guy as Ozzy: https://imgur.com/NkM7fYE.png

I want to talk about fantasy battles in movies.,"Most fantasy battles in hollywood movies have beautiful special effects but almost none of the powers are ever explained. This happens in LotR, Harry Potter and the MCU. There are other instances but I want to talk about those three. 


Gandalf will just push Saruman against the wall and then Saruman will throw Gandalf around the room. How is this being done, telekinesis or some kind of magic? We never know. The same thing happens in HP they just shoot these beams of light out of there wands will little to any explanations as to what they might do. HP does go deep into spells and potions but they are never really used in fights with characters countering each other. It tends to be two big beams from each wand clashing in the middle, it's the same stand off is used all the time in HP and it gets boring. 


Now I want to bring up Anime which does fantasy the most and the best. In their battles powers and abilities are explained a lot and how a seemingly unbeatable ability has some kind of weak spot the character has to find. Examples that have great writing with powers and battles are Naruto and JoJo. 


You can skip this part of you want, I'm going to give some examples. In Naruto Hidan is immortal, you can stab his heart, or cut off his head and he will not die. He is impossible the kill and our heroes have to find a way to beat him. Another ability is if he licks the blood of an opponent off his blade then when he stables himself the injury goes to the other person. (This causes a main character death) Shikamaru devises a plan to defeat the immortal Hidan, he puts him under shadow possession jutsu so Hidan is forced to copy what ever Shikamaru does. He uses this to take Hidan to a place in the forest where he planted paper bombs. Hidan then cuts Shikamaru's face and stabs himself in the chest. Shikamaru takes no damage since he put another enemies blood on the blade tricking Hidan into injuring his own ally. All the paper bombs are blown up, Hiden is in pieces, then he falls into a deep whole in the ground where he is buried by rock so he will never get out. He is still alive but he can never reassemble his body and fight again. This is the kind of writing I like in fantasy were abilities how to be countered in some complicated way. Also having Hidan immortal makes him feel like a very big threat even though he is a short lived character in the series. 


Contrast this will Harry Potter where they shoot spells and block them with no explanation then suddenly this spell kills a character. Why couldn't he block it like the other spells and attacks, this stuff isn't explained. Same goes for the MCU, Thanos has the Reality Stone and Time stone and can use then to what seems no end. It would be so much more interesting is he has to learn how to use the reality stone and there is some limit on what he can do with it since he only just got it. But no he can make guns into bubbles with no explanation. And that battle with Thanos and Dr Strange looked cool, the problem is I don't feel anything, there is no tension and I have no scene of who is winning or losing in the fight, it is just unexplained special effects. 


In Naruto you think Shikamaru will die when Hidan stabes himself since is ability has been established. This makes you feel that Shikamaru is about to lose, but surprise Shikamaru uses Hidan's ability against Hidan's ally. I specifically love this fight because Shikamaru is a physically weak character and can not preform crazy feats of strength like other characters do. He has to use his brain and come up with a strategy to defeat a much more powerful enemy.  


There is another example from a JoJo fight I wanted to use. There is a Stand, it's the spirit of the users which has powers. It has the ability to attack someone from inside a mirror. Polnareff can not attack this stand since his stand can not enter the mirror. This is very well done since how can Polnareff attack something like this. He ends up drawing the stand into the desert where there are no mirrors. The stand is now jumping from the reflection in peoples eyes. Since Polnareff knows the few options for the stand to jump from reflection to refection. He predicts where the stand will go next. This allows Polnareff to attack the stand in the middle of going from one reflection to another, defeating it in the end.  

What I'm curious about is why don't hollywood movies have writing like this in battles? It's all fancy effects but who is winning and loses doesn't exist since the audience has no idea what they are even using to attack each other and what attacks are more powerful. What do you guys think of fantasy battles in Hollywood movies compared to anime? And what American movies have complicated power systems that are explained like the examples I gave? I have yet to find any.",movies,1553529818,Tristan_Culbert,23,0,True,2019-03-25

I love the film Boxing Helena (1993).,"Way back in early 1993, I read an rather extensive four-page article in Entertainment Weekly which detailed it's insane plot and equally crazy production controversy.   Probably the most bizarre point made about the film is was it NOT a horror film in which an brilliant, reclusive surgeon amputates the limbs of the woman he's obsessed with...but something far different.

I finally got to see the film on video after playing in limited release (our cookie-cutter multiplex didn't dare play it).  After hearing from critics that it was less than stellar, it did not distract from the fact that for much of its length, I felt Boxing Helena was a remarkably subversive erotic psychodrama.

I also liked that the film addresses the dangerous and subversive potential of irrational passion beneath formal elegance and apparent sexual sophistication.  Obsession and desire shape individuality and the film examines its consequences. 

Another interesting takeaway is that the respective traits associated with gender are taken to a rather bizarre conclusion: Sands longs to keep Fenn the object of his desire while and Fenn may just yield to the masochist stirrings of her newly immobile status and subsequent dependence on him. 

Sands exudes pathetic masculinity, clinging to morbid fantasies as a means of sexual empowerment. The shifting sexual power balance between these characters makes for an rather off-putting, involving tension the film effectively toys with for it's length. 

The constant shifting of erotic perspective is an admirable achievement even if in other respects the film seems silly, contrived and even most unconvincing at times.  (Sands running and moaning after witnessing Helena hooking up with a ridiculous club promoter played by Bill Paxton is not a strong moment in the film).  But nonetheless, it's quite a memorable addition to the 90's arthouse film catalog.

I didnt think Jordan Peele's US was that good.,"SPOILERS 
I understand that the movie had a deeper philosophical meaning behind it that was supposed to resemble the idea that our country was built on the backs of people that we try to forget about, i.e. the tethered. But i really feel like peele sacrificed a coherent story for symbolism. The story didnt make a whole lot of sense to me. Why were there clones? Maybe we were never meant to take it all so literally but its a visual movie. When the main idea of the movie is metaphorical, the story and events of the film dont seem to take shape at all. Nothing was really flushed out and it kept changing every 45 minutes. Also the humor in the movie threw me off. This was like tyler perrys house of horrors and i couldnt commit my head to the idea that any of this was supposed to be scary. There were scary parts but it kept breaking its own horror momentum with these jokes. Am i the only one here that feels like this? Maybe i just dont get his style.

A conspiracy theory that fixes The Last Jedi,"*Star Wars: The Last Jedi* - to say that a **lot** has been said about this movie is an understatement. But today I am not telling you about how I despised that movie, or how I found it brilliant. I am here to present a theory (first postulated by others) that the film was greatly restructued in reshoots and editing.

""But how?"" you would say. ""Both 'Rogue One' and 'Solo' dealt with heavy reshoots and the news were all over it!"" Well, that is the ""conspiracy"" part that postulates that an effort was made to keep the changes made to The Last Jedi off the press. As to why - I cannot say. Perhaps it was to cover up the mistakes of the higher-ups, or to ""preserve an agenda"", or maybe simply because it never leaked and Lucasfilm was able to control the narrative to avoid bad publicity.

While much of what follows is pure speculations, there are also some public facts that support this theory. Anyway, when originally written, shot and edited, The Last Jedi went as follows:

* The movie originally opened as the Resistance was evacuating from **Crait** while the First Order advanced. This key presumption comes from the fact revealed in the ""Making Of"" book that [the opening battle was not originally over D'Qar](https://io9.gizmodo.com/16-fascinating-revelations-about-the-making-of-star-war-1821389649) and the opening scene features [obvious green-scren replacement.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2MqAiXPXFU&amp;t=15s)

* Of course, the battle progressed not quite like in the final movie. While the Resistance still had the fleet they were evacuating as thw Walkers closed by, the speeders were sent out to buy some time as a diversion. It makes sense to send out troopers and speeders as a delaying strategy, while in the final cut they end up contributing nothing and would be of much better use hiding behind the supposdely impenetrable door.

* Neither Luke, nor Rey with Chewie and the Falcon are present on Crait. The duel between Luke and Kylo does not happen, Resistance simply escapes. It is possible Finn was still present - the same ""Making Of"" book reveals that he originally participated in the opening battle, so either he woke up much earlier, or the movie began some time later than *immediately* following TFA.

* Now that the Resistance escapes from Crait, the opening space battle happens. Only the drednaught has no guns that fired on the planet below (again, ""Making Of"" book) and is not quite an imminent danger to the fleet. Some dialogue was changed in the reshoots, but originally Poe's decision to commit to the attack was indeed quite reckless instead of coming up as a reasonable loss against a major threat.

* Slow space chase progresses mostly the same. However, we know that [many of Holdo's lines were redubbed in the post](https://www.slashfilm.com/star-wars-the-last-jedi-deleted-scenes/2/), which could have also been used to change the overcall structure.

* Canto Bight is much longer in this version. Both ""The Art of"" and ""Making of"" books revealed that Canto Bight sequence was intended to be much longer, with entire sets being build that were entirely abscent from the movie. Some of those deleted scenes are found on the Blu-Ray release, while others, involving the chase afther the ""Butcher of Brix"" were glimpsed in screenplay pages shown in behind-the-scenes video. The original Codebreaker was to have a much larger role in the plot, assisting Finn and Rose until was caught up by the law enforcement.

* Everything with Luke and Rey on the island happens the same. After Rey leaves, Luke has a scene with Yoda and that is the last we see of him in the movie.

* Now, the climax takes place on Snoke's ship. There is no planets for Resistance to escape to, so Holdo's plan always involved a sacrifice play. That's the entire reason why she keeps it from Poe: she knows it's their only chance in a hopeless situation and don't want him to try and stop her.

* Now, the famous [disappearing dagger.](https://i.imgur.com/keoETLL.gif). The theory postulates that it was not a sloppy choreography mistake fixed with CGI, no. Instead, Rey was meant to actually be stabbed - notice how she gasps when the dagger is about to hit her. The wound would not be fatal, but it would be her ""losing arm"" moment and would have restricted her mobility, which becomes very important.

* If you saw the Plinkett review, you remember how he wanted the movie to end right when Kylo offered Rey to join him? Well, this theory suggests that it did. Either Rey joined Kylo or it was left ambigous - she was still injured and was with him at the end, creating a massive cliffhanger. All ends are tied up: Snoke is dead, the Resistance escapes thanks to Holdo's sacrifice and there is a sequel hook to keep the audience in suspence. Maybe we see Luke looking at Twin Suns.

""So, what happened?"" you say. Well, two things happen. One is that The Force Awakens's biggest criticism was following the plot of A New Hope to a beat. The scenario I just laid out also does the exact same thing with The Empire Strikes Back, so what they do is create a fourth act by moving the ""snowspeeders against walkers on a white planet"" part to the end and adding new material to it. The other is that studio executives see that Luke Skywalker ends up doing absolutely nothing in the whole movie, which had a fight against the Red Guards at the end, but no real lightsaber fight. Rian Johnson is asked to include one and here's where the rewrite happen.

By this point Colin Trevorrow is still working on Episode 9. He would later leave this [cryptic tweet to Mark Hamill](https://mobile.twitter.com/colintrevorrow/status/1001795335331745792). The same Mark Hamill who went on to say [that he approved of what Trevorrow did](https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2018/03/rumour-colin-trevorrow-fired-star-wars-episode-ix-due-disagreements-last-jedi/) while being [openly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKlo-plLJZI) [critical](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQk0HNv81oA) about TLJ. It would appear that Trevorrow's Episode 9 dealt with still alive Luke, and the decision to kill him made much later than the principal photography, adding injury to Mark Hamill's insult. Rian Johnson also talked in the commentary how he experimented with keeping Luke alive by just cutting away from him during the editing. It shows that the final decision as whether to kill Luke Skywalker in Episode 8 was not yet made.

* While other scenes in the movie were either re-edited or re-dubbed to fit the new structure, Crait saw some promiment reshoots to create a new final act. Instead of staying with Kylo, Rey now rejoins the group - how sloppy the change is evident in the final film. We last see her in Supreme Leader's Throne Room in the middle of the massive ship, then a character says off-screen that she stole ""Snoke's personal shuttle"" which we never see at all, and when we next see her, she already contacted Chewie and re-boarded the Falcon, shooting at TIE Fighters with a glee on her face and not a trail of the emotinal trauma she faced less than an hour ago. The scene of her lifting rocks also contains some obvious green screen.

* Everything with Luke on Crait is new and part of the reshoots. So are most scenes in the ""bunker"" set, while the outdoor action is repurposed from the original opening. You can see some sings that Crait almost resets everything in the final cut: Instead of being cripped by Holdo's maneuver, the First Order is instantly able to deploy the walkers and the cannon. Instead of willing to ""let the past die"" Kylo goes back to screaming in rage, as if his conversation with Rey never happened. Poe is proclaimed as a leader by Leia, who demoted him earlier, and that is before he started the munity! Not to mention that the extended fourth act makes the film too long, taking it way the past the point where it should logically have ended.

In the documentary on Blu-Ray Rian Johnson says:
&gt; I feel like I need to rewrite the opening sequence, in terms of the big-picture stuff of what's going on. Watching the whole thing together, I freaked... I freaked out. Because I'm like, ""this doesn't track."" You can't follow what's happening. You can't follow what the big stakes are. I got really scared.

So how come nobody said all this out loud? Well, there's some conspiracy thinking here, but basically damage control. New Lucasfilm management seems much more tight compared to its predecessors. Author J.W. Rinzler, who wrote great in-detail books about the making of the Origial Trilogy as well as Episode 3, started working on TFA, but [https://www.herocollector.com/en-us/Article/abandoned-the-lost-tie-in-books](later told this:)

&gt; ""There was no chance that book was going to be published. I knew when I started writing it that it would be cancelled... there were a lot of things that were known to the public that I think Disney and Kathleen Kennedy just didn't want to rehash. 

Now, imagine the things *not* known to the public, and remember that his books revealed many hitherto unknown facts about the original films, which were some of the most-documented movies of all time. And then [Tony Gilroy](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/star-wars-rogue-one-writer-tony-gilroy-opens-up-reshoots-1100060) revealed last year that Rogue One reshoots were of larger scale than initially reported. It could be that after bad press around Rogue One re-edits and firing of Lord and Miller from Solo, Lucasfilm was desperate to report a clear, smooth production, especially since they already gave the director his own trilogy.

We don't know what NDAs were signed and how many people aren't talking because they still work on these movies. Could be that the layer of overall secrecy meant that most of those involved (both cast and crew) never knew the whole picture to begin with, not to mention that story changing during production and editing is nothing new in any major production.

Whether you liked The Last Jedi or hated it (there is no option in between, as internet tells me), I will let you decide for yourself: imagine the movie beginning with Crait (sans Luke and Rey) and ending with the awesome silent lightspeed-ramming scene, followed by Rey taking Kylo's hand. Wouldn't that be a more intersting movie with much higher stakes for Episode 9?",movies,1553530762,Malachi108,47,0,True,2019-03-25
Spoilers details and theories for Us,"I've watches every possible video about missing details I could find about this movie and here is what I have pieced together so far and some of my theories, also details that make scene once you think about them. I will also discuss how this relates to Get Out

Theory: When the family is sitting at the table and Jason (the son) says ""I don't remember how to do this magic trick."" It because he was switch with his tethered. This somewhat makes sense if you think about it, the other Jason or in this case, Pluto who could have been swapped with Jason before the movie would have known how to do the magic trick. So the Jason we see is the tethered. This is what towards the end of the movie when Adelaide screams when Pluto goes into the fire it is because that was her real true son. Red in this case would have been able to teach Jason english and then Pluto and Jason could have swapped

\_\_

When Adelaide is on the couch before the family goes to the beach, we see a spider crawling on the table, in the begging of the movie Adelaide is whistling the itsy bites spider. Also before Adelaide is swapped with Red under her shirt is wearing a *Hands Across America* tee, this is why at the end of the movie we see hundreds of others holding hands. For the years that the real Adelaide was trapped underneath, this is what she kept looking at. As well as why her voice is so shaky and also could have been damaged when she was strangled. This also relates to why she was not speaking at the doctors office, she did not know english so she just was quite.

\_\_\_\_

When Adelaide is killing Red or vise versa, she lets out a scream like sound that is similar to how the tethered speak. Which makes more sense once we know how everything plans out and happens. Also how Adelaide handcuffs red to the bed brings us back full circle to the begging when she was first swapped and handcuffed to the bed.

\_\_\_

How this relates to *Get Out*

Theory

So in Get Out we know that white people are trying to take the body and souls of black people. When the tethered first come into Adelaide house, Red explains how you can make a copy but you cannot copy the soul. So we can speculate that the Armitage family was making copies of black people and trying to see if the soul could be transferred. Since they later found an easier method of transferring the soul and body, they stopped making clones aka the tethered. They thought that soon enough the tethered would die off but since they didn't they attack their real clone in hopes to get their souls and bodies.

\_\_

The title of the movie

The title as we all know is called Us. When Gabe ask what are you Red says "" We're Americans."" Relating back to the title, Us or it could be see as United States. Hence why Red would want to do hands across American. Because she wants Us or the United States to be taken over by the tethered.

You might be lucky to get a couple deleted scenes, an ""unrated"" version of the film and some bloopers, but that's about it.

"'Call me by your name' should not be celebrated as a movie that depicts wholesome homoesexual relations. Instead, it serves as a cautionary tale about the underage being taken advantage of by older people. The LGBT and ""tasteful"" sexual themes it explored ultimately covered it's true message","I never watch movies upon their release, so this may be nothing new to you. Proceed with caution if you haven't seen it yet, and intend to do so.

Whether you've seen/read it or not, the audience and critics describe it as a ""sensual"" or ""enhralling"" coming-of-age story about the blooming 'love' between two men. Except: one of them is 17, the other is 24. Regardless of whether there was real love involved, only the 17 year old ends up completely shattered as he didn't know better than to fall in love with the predator. Managing expectations is one thing, but the balance is completely off when one is emotionally underdeveloped. The predator ends up marrying a woman he never told him about, and the boy is obviously heartbroken. 

The only wholesome part of this story is that the father knows and is supportive of homosexual relations. He encourages his son to not suppress his emotions, and to cherish the amazingly special connection he had with the other. At the same time, his son's 24 year old love interest worked for him as a research assistant. How is it okay to be colleagues with a man whose underage son you end up fucking? 

The son is amazingly moody and is a constant brooding mess, nothing unexpected from a 17 year old boy after all. He is unsure about his sexuality, and didn't need his first sexual exploration to be with someone so old. I am not condemning sex; all would have been fine if they were both closer in age.

The last scene, in which the young boy is completely devastated and mourning is soul crushing, but not for the reasons the audience and critics relate to. In my opinion, what is so hard to accept is that someone so much more experienced basically told him that he ""Hopes he didn't mess him up, and that he enjoyed sleeping with him"" while the 17 year old was expecting way, way more. 

I enjoyed the movie for how artistic it was, and how exciting it is to explore one's sexuality at a young age. At the same time, I believe the story was intended to warn people of the darker sides, and that lust can blind. ",movies,1553535584,AngelaRansley,82,0,True,2019-03-25

Unlike the adults who we see throughout the film constantly distracting themselves, the mom with her family life, the daughter with her phone, the dad with his...boat?

I just watched Cannibal Holocaust,"Before I watched this movie I heard about the animal cruelty and thought it wouldn't affect me. I'm not a vegan never really cared about eating meat. In fact before watching the movie I had chicken. The turtle scene made me want to puke it all out as I was watching it. The other animal scenes though terrible didn't affect me though. I thought the monkey died quickly and so did the pig (I read they killed a meercat too can someone tell me when that happens). Anyway I find this the stupidest decision made by the filmmaker it turned to many people away from a good movie. The idea was good the acting whole iffy sometimes is watchable but what really got me was the message and soundtrack that'll probably be stuck in my head forever. After watching the film I've looked into its making and that messed me up even more. The director is literally portraying himself. For those who don't know the actors were treated very badly by the director. The female actress had issue shooting a nude scene and was rebuked (the cast was also paid terribly). The extras were made to stand in the burning hut without protective equipment and weren't paid anything it's a pure exploitative movie. I feel the way the movie is made is terrible but it is something worth watching. However it's not something you should support. The whole movie is up on YouTube https://youtu.be/84wGdW3Yvj4

The Deer Hunter has only 1 scene going for it (all 3 hours and 3 minutes of it)," have some opinions on it that would be to people's disliking (but I don't care, it's just my opinion, everyone's entitled to theirs. There's no right or wrong opinion). I was going to make a post about why I didn't like this film, but then I saw this review by someone, and they perfectly described exactly how I felt about it:

&amp;#x200B;

Just got finished watching this movie for the first time ever. For years, I had heard nothing but great things about ""The Deer Hunter"", such as it's a masterpiece, a classic, etc. Because of this, I went into this film with high expectations and was sorely disappointed with what I had seen.

""The Deer Hunter"" is one of those films that has one (maybe two) fantastic scenes and the rest of the picture is complete rubbish. A similar film is Inglorious Basterds (another war epic) with the opening scene at the farm being terrific but the rest of the film is just awful. In this sense, The Deer Hunter reminded me a lot of Inglorious Basterds. The Russian Roulette sequence in the Vietcong hut is absolutely breathtaking- the acting is high caliber, the tension is through the roof, the cinematography perfect. This scene is one of the best in film history. However, this one scene cannot cover the other, various issues that plague the film such as meandering plot, useless and overlong (way overlong) wedding scene, annoying characters, unsatisfying ending, choppy editing (Oscar for Best Film Editing, seriously?), and unwarranted three hour run-time. The entire first hour is a poor and overlong build up to the fantastic Russian Roulette scene in Vietcong hut. After this scene, movie goes nowhere for another 2 hours.

I understand this was the first Vietnam movie to come out in the wake of the Vietnam war. As such, it struck a chord and was a big deal in 1978. However, outside of one scene I cannot say that I really found this to be an enjoyable or even a thought-provoking war movie like Platoon (1986) or Full Metal Jacket (1987). Ironically enough, the first Vietnam movie to be made is the one that had the least impact, at least for me.

&amp;#x200B;

(BACK TO MY WORDS): For the record, I liked Inglorious Basterds. I also believe that De Niro and Walken were incredible, it's just that there was a lot of not incredible things going on for them to be in. I understand the film is all about how the war effects people etc. I get it, I just couldn't get into it. It's incredibly long (and not in a clever or artistic way, it's overly long) and nothing happens for so much of it. Did we need the wedding to be that long? No. It was all because the director didn't know he wanted for it. There's so much unnecessary stuff. I just didn't like it, the russian roulette scene was amazing, and honestly, that's all it has going for it now.

"Bad remakes, Open Your Eyes to Vanilla Sky","I recently watched the Spanish film Open Your Eyes (1997) directed by Alejandro Amen√°bar (The Others).

It was an utter masterpiece about a wealthy and handsome man called Cesar (Eduardo Noriega) who was a complete slimeball and downfall came about by his own vanity and hubris. Not giving anything away, he is plagued by his dreams and a mysterious traumatic event which he is responsible for. We are taken down wormhole, unknowing of what is reality, dream, or nightmare.

The film is dark, cynical and unapologetic. The storytelling is tight and the cinematography feels experimental and stylistic choices have been made. The low budget makes it feel grounded, more realistic in the conventions of its storytelling. It is a true masterpiece. 

The acting is superb. Eduardo Noriega is utterly convincing as the unsympathetic main character, Penelope Cruz is absolutely stunning and acts as an effective heroine, Najwa Nimri's performance is heartbreaking as a lovelorn women sourness by Cesar. There are more excellent performance that are low-key and feel real.

I really recommend you watch this film.

Now unfortunately, Open Your Eyes was remade with the film Vanilla Sky (2001) directed by Cameron Crowe and starring Tom Cruise. Now, this is a real shame because a competent could have take the original story and made a really stellar dark and grounded blockbuster. But stragely, Crowe was chosen to helm the project and he turned it in to a romantic comedy. The main character is completely changed, he is no longer a brute. In fact, it is the complete opposite, Tom Cruise lays the charm on real thick and it's kind of sickening to watch. The script has been infused with jokes and cliche dialogue that feel really unnecessary and out of place. Penelope Cruz was recast in the same role, and it just feels wrong...she has aged visibly (which I suppose is to be expected with an older cast) and her role also has too much charm and doesn't feel real. Jason Lee seems to have stumbled out if one of his stoner comedy movies with an over-the-top performance. The strangest element is that Cameron Diaz plays the role of the spurned lover in this film and the idea of anyone passing up Diaz is really unconvincing.

Just comparing the performances and characterization between Nimri and Diaz exemplifies the differences in each film. Nimri plays a women who is clearly crippled with depression, suffering from alcohol abuse and possibly a sex addict. She is beautiful but there is also a harshness to her beauty. It's a small role but she leaves a big impression. Whereas Diaz just seems perfect, out-of-this-world-stunning and charming. Diaz's ultimate action of crashing the car just seems totally contrived, it's a complete character change, like the screenwriter flipped the switch to crazy. Crowe even uses this as an opportunity to insert jokes. In the original, this part is really disturbing and comes about organically.

Crowe completely sanitises all of the dark elements that made Open Your Eyes so spectacular...and it's a very confusing choice. Surely the star power of the cast was more than enough to draw in the audience, why change it in to a rom-com?

It's a shame because most viewers will have seen Vanilla Sky instead of Open Your Eyes, and then all the intrigue and mystery of the original for them is ruined. So the legacy of the original masterpiece is unfortunately diminished.

Anyway, I have said my piece. Please submit more film's that legacy has been diminished by bad remakes. I want to discover more films that have been overshadowed unfairly.",movies,1550889641,nevereatpears,15,0,True,2019-02-22

Paddington (2015) Movie Review,"[Here's the original review](http://scifipsycho.blogspot.com/2019/02/paddington-2014-movie-review.html)

&amp;#x200B;

""Paddington"" fills its viewers with nostalgia in the same way that the titular bear fills his sandwiches with marmalade.  
 

The movie tells the heartwarming tale of¬† an anthropomorphic bear who is  forced by circumstances to leave his home in ""Darkest Peru"" and move to  London. We accompany the bear in his attempts to adjust to a new life  in the city.  
 

Paddington belongs to the rare breed of movies that manage to capture  the innocence of childhood, while still being relevant to an older  audience. In this aspect, it feels like a close relative of the Japanese  animator Hayao Miyazaki's movies. There are a few touches of magical  realism, especially in the way the mural in the house of his new family  changes to reflect the mood of the house.  
 

What makes the movie special is that it does not shy away from death and  violence just to be palatable to a younger audience. Nicole Kidman is  perfectly cast as the cartoonish villain with vile motives. Though it  comes as no surprise that our adorable bear manages to survive her  plans.  
 

Director Paul King has created a movie that seems like something Wes  Anderson and Terry Gilliam would make if they were to collaborate  together for a Disney movie. ""Paddington"" is a children's fable, a  coming-of-age film and a tale about an immigrant's experiences, all at  once. It is the cinematic equivalent of warm soup on a cold winter  evening.

* The Favourite: Wonderfully shot and costumed. Clever premise. Excellent chemistry between leads.
* A Star is Born: Bravura. Solid performances, specifically Gaga. Too much ‚Äútell‚Äù at ending.
* Vice: Transformative Bale likely wins. Dicks' diabolical. Comes up ""little short.""
* Black Panther: My return to MCU. Richly rendered. Wakanda revisit deserved ASAP.
* BlackkKlansman: Timely and topical, sure. Expected more. Ultimately, forgettable for me.
* Bohemian Rhapsody: Sex? Drugs? Nope. Just sanitized PG-13 lip-synced rock'n'roll. Entertaining, though.
* Green Book: Predictable and an idealized telling but still endearing and entertaining.
* First Man: Action: riveting. Family: grows tiresome. I guess that‚Äôs the point.
* Can You Ever Forgive Me: Wonderful change of pace. Flawed, likable leads. Best unlikley winner.

* Isle of Dogs: Quirky, typical Wes. Not my style but applaud the undertaking.
* RBG: Wonderfully empathetic and humanizing. Important non-partisan moments needed right now.
* A Night at the Garden: Frightening found footage but not a standalone ""documentary."" Needed more.
* A Quiet Place: Fantastic, novel. No exposition needed. Why have another baby though?
* Animal Behaviour: Clever conceit. Genuinely funny. Not for your average voter though.
* At Eternity's Gate: Nearly unwatchable for me. Experimental, abstract maybe? Felt declasse.
* Avengers: Less than the sum of its cast. Overgrown and disjointed.
* Bao: Standard Pixar fare, for better and worse. Beautiful, emotional, formulaic.
* Black Sheep: Interview + Dramatization. Interesting but superficial. Felt like a Dateline episode.
* Detainment: Controversial.  Engrossing, hair raising. Amazing performances by two young actors.
* End Game: Revealing, intimate, tear inducing. Only complaint: uneven coverage of patients.
* Fauve: Lord of the Flies, in a quarry. Innocence heartbreakingly lost.
* First Reformed: Stark, spare but has points of view. ‚ÄúDream‚Äù lost me.
* Free Solo: Dizzying visuals. Introspective and frank interviews.. Don't forget to breathe.
* Hale County: Visceral footage wasted by a lack of a narrative structure.
* Incredibles 2: Started strong, but a foreseeable twist. Entertaining enough for parents.
* Late Afternoon: Poignant but predictable ending. Dreamlike memory sequences were well done.
* Lifeboat: Expected more lifeboat logistics, instead mostly tribute to the Captain.
* Marguerite: Forbidden love remembered. Sweet and heartfelt but not my style.
* Minding the Gap: Skateboarder documentary morphs into heartrending commentary on childhood and abuse.
* Mother: Breakneck pace. Simple concept, well executed. Feature sequel coming soon.
* One Small Step: Pleasant father-daughter twist of an aspirational but familiar storyline.
* Period. End of Sentence: A non-profit's informercial. Doesn't fully investigate the topic's underlying stigma.
* Ralph Breaks the Internet: Clever and referential. Offers a valuable life lesson about friendship.
* Ready Player One: Decent adaptation of a favorite novel. Loved the nostalgic nods.
* Skin: Visceral first half. Gratuitously absurd twist took away from ending.
* Solo A Star Wars Story: Fine origin story. Lacked an early hook or lasting impression.
* The Wife: Smoldering performance by Close. Unnecessary, disruptive flashbacks. Ending too tidy.
* Weekends: Perfect distillation of a divorced child's parental seesaw. Personally affecting.

[Discussion] Why Pixar's Coco is a bad movie. *possible spoilers*,"I swear. Everything with Ernesto was so fucking bad. 

At first I thought the twist would be that Ernesto is his real dad, but then he found that out at the first 15 minutes. I was glad they weren‚Äôt gonna do that twist at the end, but then they chose something much more predictable. Ernesto was evil the whole time! Who would‚Äôve thunk that the main bad guy is gonna be a surprise villain? That‚Äôs so original for Pixar to do that, since they only did that before with toy story 2, toy story 3, and Wall-E. The person that the main character thought was so great, and admired it for years? 

A famous person that inspired our main character to pursue his passion is really the villain of the story? Who could‚Äôve seen that coming? Except for everyone that already saw Up. The movie‚Äôs plot and characters are Pixar at their most formulaic. I‚Äôm not a Pixar hater at all, I grew up (insert stuckmann joke here) with a lot of their movies, but out of their last 8 movies, 6 were mediocre at best, one was good/charming (coco) and only one came close to the creativity they once had. Not acting like every single one of their movies were flawless before, but they all felt extremely unique and had their own world. I was never excited for TS4, but when I heard they‚Äôre gonna make incredibles 2 i was excited. After seeing it, it was just another forgettable movie. And wow! Fucking fantastic scores too, don‚Äôt know why they died. As a musical-ish movie, coco‚Äôs actual score was super forgettable.",movies,1550897034,sparxthemonkey,15,0,True,2019-02-22

A while back I saw a Letterboxd review for ""The Wife"" (Glenn Close) that criticizing how the flight attendant being the same on both flights was used as a framing device and I've literally been racking my brain since trying to figure out what in the hell that means. 

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not a film student/scholar in any way so I don't *really* know what a framing device is. I googled it, and the definition said that it is a story within a story? Which makes sense, but does not make sense on how the flight attendant would be one.

Examples of actors in films that are in there for no reason.,"So for some reason, I decided to watch Fist Fight, and in doing so, I was ultimately confused by the presence of Chrsitina Hendricks. There is absolutely no need for her character, let alone have an actor like her be cast. When she is established it comes off like ""Oh, she's the really sexy teacher who is incredibly strict."" And then she is not in the film from then on, minus 1 or 2 scenes where she provides nothing to the story, not even just for some comedic parts. And then I wondered, what are some other examples of actors (preferably big names) who are in a film (maybe even made to seem like they're in it for the majority), but do nothing, are barely in it or add nothing to the story? I'm not referring to cameos, those are there own thing. And I'm not talking about big actors who are in it for a scene or 2 but still bring something (like Sam Jackson and the Rock in The Other Guys). I mean big actor -&gt; supposedly in a big role -&gt; not actually in a big role -&gt; does nothing with that role anyway.",movies,1550899840,typhy23,42,0,True,2019-02-23

Texting in movie theaters seems to be becoming more prevalent and I'm getting so sick and tired of it.,"I don't know if I'm just having bad luck but the last five times I've been to the theaters I've had someone either sitting next to me or in front of me texting or playing a game on their phone during the movie. Tonight was especially bad, as I had a guy sitting to my right who was snoring loudly during most of the movie and his friend to his right texting during the whole thing. I asked him to put his phone away and he did initially, but then pulled it out and continued texting 10 minutes later. 

I don't understand how people will spend $15-$20 to see a movie and then not even pay attention to it. Beyond that, it's so disrespectful to those who spent their money to enjoy this movie and now can't pay attention because they have your bright phone screen blinding them during the whole thing. If a conversation is that important, just take it outside, you clearly don't care about the movie anyway. 

Anyone else seeing this problem getting worse or have I just had bad luck? I seriously have anxiety whenever I go to the movies now, wondering whether or not I'm gonna sit next to a texter. I'm 25 so it's not like I'm too old to ""get it"". I just think that if you're going to spend money to go to a movie, you should pay attention, or at the very least not prevent others from being able to do so.

From a pretty wooden cast, a very clumsy first act and ending (IMO the film's middle section is when its at its best), to subpar CGI, and even to is cliche ridden narrative it just falls really flat with me and baffles me how much success and love it is receiving. When comparing to all of the other Best Picture noms it pales in comparison. It feels like a very weak link in the MCU to me. Not terrible, but in the realms of the first two Thor films and Iron Man 3. It just didn't as special to me as everyone is making it out to seem. Anyone agree?

What movie would have been better as a TV series?,"What movies could have used the longer runtime of a TV series to flesh-out and nail their story, characters, themes, and setting?  


**The Purge** movies would be my first pick. Split the first movie into a 10 episode season with the first 3-5 episodes dedicated to the build up to the day of the purge followed by the remaining episodes covering the duration of the purge. Alternatively, have a non-linear narrative that jumps back and forth in time to start the show in the middle of action.   


Establish the backstories of the main characters (both the protagonists and the antagonists) in the initial episodes so that we understand their actions during the purge. Make them actually evolve as human beings. Also, heighten the psychological thriller aspect of the story than making it a generic murder/home invasion movie. Explore the wider impact of the purge on the whole society.   


**World War Z** too could have used an anthological TV series format as the book explored the zombie apocalypse across different nations and cultures instead of single man's adventure across the world as depicted in the movie. Have a 8-12 episode series with every episode focusing on telling personal stories during a zombie apocalypse from a different country. Make each episode work like a unique puzzle piece to form a whole in the end.   
I think a TV series would have accomplished all of that and more. ",movies,1550905192,Dargomir,166,46,True,2019-02-23

The idea of this is incomprehensible to me - not because I don't understand it, but that I can't fathom myself actually being able to do it.  I rarely watch more than one or two movies a month. I think I watched maybe 20 or 21 movies in all of 2018, with that number heavily dipping off by the end of the year. For example, the last time I watched a film was December when I watched Bohemian Rhapsody. Looking through older threads on here with people saying they've watched upwards of 100 or 200 movies a year is genuinely mind-boggling. It just seems like it would be mentally exhausting.

One of the best romantic comedies of the '90s,"
Sorry about the clickbait, I‚Äôm actually trying to find a movie. It‚Äôs a good one so stay for the show!

Please Help!

The Film is a rom com from the 90ies about a couple with fertility issues and their struggles to get a correct diagnoses and then artificial insemination. 

A small twist of the story is that the guy is actually writing a book about their experiences and when this comes to light along with other problems they break up.

At the end of the film the guy becomes an acclaimed writer with his second book on the way, and they are separated.

Two scenes I remember distinctly: 

* The girl needs to go to the doctor  when ovulating, and rides a scooter with crossed legs.

* At the end they the meet at a park and now the guy has a beard. The guy quetes his new book, and the girl calls him out on it. They make peace with the past and move on.

"""Jurassic Park"" (1993) is impressive on a technical standpoint but emotionally empty. None of the characters pop.","Watching Jurassic Park is a marvel to watch. People have no idea how jaw-dropping it was to watch Jurassic Park in 1993 when you weren't used to those kind of effects. Every kid in my neighborhood was obsessed with dinosaurs and Jurassic Park.

But at the same time, did anyone really care about the characters? I mean, the film tried to set up Grant (Sam Neil) as this guy who didn't like kids so they paired him with two kids, Tim and Lex, who are the least annoying kids you can imagine. They don't even cry like kids, they whimper. But it comes off as contrived and never really makes you see them develop a bond. 

And Ellie (Laura Dern) is wildly wasted in the second half when her character is left on the wayside, she's just a token female lead who isn't given much to do until the very end when she tries to set on the energy. 

I guess that's why Jurassic Park didn't truly made me invested because I can love the action and the effects but if I find the characters or story bland, I struggle to embrace it as memorable. ",movies,1550922573,Cynical_Georgie,19,0,True,2019-02-23

How do you guys feel about open ending in movies? I have watched a few such movies and it kind of makes me feel unsatisfied with the movie.,"As I said, this open ending in movies is something I see people appreciate but it makes me feel unsatisfied. Like the plot is somewhat incomplete. I don't want to make my own conclusions, what is the point of watching the movie if I have to. By watching a movie, I am actually watching a story unfold visually, how can open endings be good if it means some parts of the story is not explained and left to the viewer to form themselves.

I watched *it comes at night* few days back. In the end a lot of things were not clarified. So didn't get the satisfaction in an otherwise well made movie.

Yesterday I watched *better watch out.* The ending sucked. We were not shown what happened to the boy in the end. Either declare a sequel or make the story complete. Same was the case with *the guest.*

And today I watched *Andhadhun.* Here also the end scene was such that you would be left wondering what actually happened with the woman. No definite conclusion.

All these movies, my experience was like a good masterbation session where right at the moment you orgasm somebody catches you doing it and you have to cover up.

Alita being very ‚Äúanime‚Äù is a blessing and a curse.,"It was really satisfying and a surprisingly good adaptation, but it also was very Anime in tone, which is why i think some people call it cheesy.

The characters have exposition like an anime, the action is very extravagant like an anime, Alita is designed to look anime and is very expressive (although way more charming than her anime counterpart - not that the anime Alita is bad at all).

Even the cheesy romantic lines feel like something you would hear in an english dub.

The only big difference is Hugo is a bit more macho rather than goofy and naive, but the actor did a decent job I thought for the most part. 

Honestly as a fan of some anime films (not many) I really liked it but I also knew what to expect. Being a fan of the original movie I thought the adaptation was extremely well done and it was very exciting and engaging. Great movie to just escape and have fun in another world.

Its very sanitised, but if I had a 12-14 year old nephew or niece, son or daughter it would probably blow their minds compared to the style of action movies they would be used to. 

If you are 50-50 on seeing it, I say pull the trigger, especially if you liked the original material.

Overall, I thought it was well made, and from a technical standpoint it is near perfect, but I just didn‚Äôt enjoy it. Roma, Welcome To Marwen, and Gnome Alone (I tortured myself one night) were the three most boring movies I saw last year. 

Also please don‚Äôt downvote this post into oblivion for this but I thought that the 3rd act of A Star Is Born was weaker than the rest of the movie, and wasn‚Äôt explained clearly enough.",movies,1550935887,MetaMysterio,20,0,True,2019-02-23

Mad Max: Fury Road - The rare sequel which manages to surpass its predecessors,"Mad Max: Fury Road was one hell of a ride. Having George Miller direct the film and give him the freedom to do what he does best allowed Mad Max: Fury Road to turn out into an adrenaline-rushed, energetic, explosive action movie with a decent replacement for Mel Gibson in Tom Hardy but giving the spotlight to a new character, Furiosa, brilliantly played by Charlize Theron. A tough woman who was taken away from her place of origin and escapes from the prison she's been while taking with her the consorts of the man who kept her closed away. 

The effects are mind-blowing, you see explosions, death-defying car crashes, sand storms, shootings. It's almost like a futuristic Western set in a dystopia. Not for everybody but it is a must for those who enjoyed the Mad Max movies. Mel Gibson isn't missed (arguably). ",movies,1550937554,David_Ciofre1,18,4,True,2019-02-23

Video games have changed Hollywood,"The video game industry is now said to be larger than the movie industry. And those who play spend a lot of time in other worlds associated with science fiction, fantasy, horror, postapocalysm, history and so on. A movie is just between 90 minuter and three hours. 

The worldbuilding we used to see in movies can be impressive, but is no longer as amazing and revolutionary as it once was. Those in their 40s play more games than those on their 50s. Those in their 30s play more than those in their 40s, and those in their 20s.... and so on. So the younger the audience, the more it is used to video games. The CGI has improved a lot over the years. Of course the effects in movies are better, but gamers are probably noticing the similarities more than the differences.   
For those of us who don't play games, a movie with lot of CGI is still a movie. But for many gamers a lot of CGI probably switch their mind into game modus (judging by comments and youtube and elsewhere), even if it is actually a movie, which makes them experience it differently.

&amp;#x200B;

Worldbuilding, characters, visual effects and so on has become something gamers experience on a daily basis when playing different kind of video games. Which means that they will no longer be impressed by the visual effects and action scenes in movies any more. These days it has become so common that even I find some of the long action sequences that are added just for the sake of the action a little boring with the neverending explosions and collapsing buildings. Which means a lot of wasted time and money. 

King Kong from the 30s blew people away. A modern movie who use the same kind of effect would not be taken serioulsy.

Perhaps a little oversimplified, but Hollywood should really start to adapt to the new era. If not, more big budget movies will lose money.",movies,1550941959,Bogmount,4,0,True,2019-02-23
Here‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt think Roma will win best picture.,"I haven‚Äôt seen Roma, but it seems to be a favorite to win best picture. I don‚Äôt believe Roma will win best picture. Here‚Äôs why. For the sole fact that it is a Netflix movie. 

If you pay any attention to studio news and what not then you will know how much the academy and other film studios don‚Äôt like Netflix. In an awards show that isn‚Äôt about the best film winning and has everything to do with politics, Netflix won‚Äôt win best picture because the second it does win best picture then the entire film business will forever change. 

Quick and easy facts for everyone: 
1. Every business in the entertainment industry hates Netflix 

2. The academy hates Netflix 

3. The academy is STRICTLY politics 

3. If Roma does manage win then I guarantee that the 30 million spent on its Oscar campaign (the most expensive Oscar campaign ever) was used to bribe people.",movies,1550941964,zach4499,29,0,True,2019-02-23

Are R-RATED comedy movies dead?,"I love R-rated comedy movies. My favorite comedy of all time is Step Brothers... (I know) But, There hasn't been a lot of r-rated comedy movies lately. I say the last year for comedy movies was probably 2014. I mean you had 22 Jump Street, Neighbors, and The Interview. And if there is an R-rated comedy guarantee it's a female chick flick comedy. I think the reason for this is because of Hollywood getting PC. I mean studios are even scared to put a gorgeous pair of boobies on screen or even sex jokes. Everythings goe to PC, It sucks. (Also, I even liked The Hangover Part II.)  But hey, 24 Jump Street is being in development. It skips over 23 Jump Street lol. Maybe 24 Jump Street can revive R-RATED comedy movies if it does good in the box office, Which I'd be surprised if it doesn't, to be honest. Maybe it's a lack of marketing. Maybe it's simply because of everything to PC. But hey that's just my input. I'd love to hear you guys opinion on this matter...

"[Serious] For those who have a particular type of movie, or would otherwise not consider a certain genre, what movies are there, that when re-run on cable or one of the major networks, you will often rewatch, even though you normally wouldn't watch that genre?","For me it's:

##Westerns

I'm a fan of the genre, but not a huge fan [so not someone who tries to watch *every* one that's out just because it's a Western] but I'm not a hater - I'd probably be somewhere in the middle.

For me the films would be:

**The Good, The Bad and the Ugly**: Probably one of *the* most iconic westerns, and still good even today. Sure, it gets re-run a lot, but it's a classic that I still enjoy.

**McLintock!**: Admittedly, a little bit raunchy due to the infamous coal shuttle butt-spanking scene, but it's meant to be a sort of comedy western, if I'm right. I only really saw it over 10 years ago, think it was on ITV4 [a spin-off of ITV, which we have here in the United Kingdom]. Sure, it's nearly 60 years old, but still good in some ways as a gateway into classic comedy for those that don't want black-and-white Charlie Chaplin but want a genre they know [a western]

**Cat Ballou!**: Admittedly, I'd only read about this in magazines, but didn't see it until the mid-2000s. Sure, it's another parody western like the McLintock! example above. I'm not normally one for musicals [except, maybe, some exceptions like *Les Miserables*] - it depends. However, Lee Marvin and Nat King Cole got me interested. It's one of those that my opinion varies on - not always laugh-out-loud hilarious, but still funny, at least in terms of concept [drunken gunfighter] and dual role acting [Lee Marvin].

------

What genre of films are there that normally, you'd ignore/give a pass on, or only watch if there's something *really* good - and which specific films are there from that genre that you enjoy and will watch if they're re-run again on one of the networks?

Being from the United Kingdom, I tend to see re-runs on BBC1, Channel 4, Channel 5, ITV1 or ITV4.

I am interested to hear what your choices are.

Do explain your choices - not so much one-word answers, but a bit like how I've written them. *Why* you like them is important, even if your opinions vary about the film.

This topic is probably a slightly different one [haven't searched for other discussions] but I thought I'd ask it anyway.

Is it time to admit that Baywatch (2017) isn't as bad as everyone said it was?,"Long story short, I'm bored one night and take a chance on *Baywatch* on Netflix, thinking at the most it could serve as an entertainingly awful movie in the vein of the *Sharknado* saga, or at the least it'll serve as background fodder while I read.

After twenty minutes of the film I was... shocked to say the least. I feel like the disdain for the film is over blown. Don't get me wrong, it's not a particularly good movie. The film tries too hard to be funny to feel sincere, the characterization of the Rock's character (Mitch?) and Efron's (Ryan Lochte, let's not kid ourselves) are way off to the point that they both swap off as the loveable doofus and the straight man where the script needs them to. And yes, it was attempting to be a *21 Jump Street* with its meta- commentary but fell far short.

And yet... there's more heart than I was expecting. You get the feeling that these are all a team that care about each other, that care about the job. Alexandra Daddario and Efron play well off each other, and the way Mitch cares about his team is very endearing. The film managed to surprise me with some jokes that I thought hit the mark as well, like the pool party scene.

It wasn't a masterpiece, but I'd expect it to be weighted higher than 17% on RT. It makes me wonder if the original TV series didn't exist, would this film have done better?",movies,1550945123,Shadow-Lemming,24,0,True,2019-02-23

"Rant ahead: In the case of either event, does 20th Century Fox remain owned by 21st Century Fox? As such, does that mean the planned new Fox company is canceled and 21st Century Fox keeps all of its IP?","[ seekingalpha.com/news/3435404-bloomberg-brazil-set-rule-disney-fox-deal-next-week](https://seekingalpha.com/news/3435404-bloomberg-brazil-set-rule-disney-fox-deal-next-week)

Disney is on the verge of buying out much of the 21st Century Fox Empire: the movie divisions and 20th Century Fox TV would be owned by Disney whereas the remaining TV networks (Fox TV, Fake News Channel) would be spun-off into a planed new Fox company. 

Say Brazil does say ""Yes"" to the merger but Disney and Fox are somehow unable to not sell those sports channels that the USDOJ ruled both companies have to sell within 90 days of the deal closing. Let's also say that Brazil says ""no"" to the merger. **In the case of either event, does 20th Century Fox remain owned by 21st Century Fox? As such, does that mean the planned new Fox company is canceled and 21st Century Fox keeps all of its IP?** Thus, the only way for the Fox Marvel characters to get into the MCU is if Fox sold them off or licensed them to Disney.   


For those that do answer, I am fine with speculative answers like ""AFAIK, yes""

 I am opposed to the merger because Disney has gotten too big. Also, 104 years of Fox film history being thrown under the figurative bus (the bosses of Big Media Company A are fine with Big Media Company B absorbing most of the former's empire) is lame to me. Murdoch and Pals are legally allowed to sell Fox but I think that is a big mistake.

Netflix suggesting ‚ÄúBehind the Curve‚Äù is disturbing," I saw this film suggested on my Netflix account and thought it must be a fact checked documentary on the flat earthers movement.  After a few minutes, it is super clear this is an unchecked, unfiltered conspiracy propaganda film where they tell the viewer ‚Äúthere must be something wrong with them if they don‚Äôt believe them‚Äù. How can Netflix post and suggest such clear lies and manipulations?  Would they allow the same for a ‚ÄúAll school shooting as false flag operations‚Äù film or ‚ÄúThe Nazis were right‚Äù film.  I know Netflix isn‚Äôt a newspaper or other fact based media outlet, but this seems morally bankrupt to peddle this for views (even suggest it) at the detriment of society.

Is Rotten Tomatoes reliable?,[removed],movies,1550957738,_Nobody_No-One_,0,1,True,2019-02-23
Audience anticipation for Captain Marvel is at a whopping 48% on rotten tomatoes. Why?,"I think it could be for a number of reasons. 

First of all, I will admit that I thought the first two trailers were VERY meh. However I took no particular offense to ‚ÄúHer -&gt; A Hero‚Äù, except I thought it was cringe, like all text screens in trailers. All of the TV spots except for the super bowl one restored my anticipation for Captain Marvel by a little bit. I am now only excited for Captain Marvel because of the extremely positive reactions on twitter. The marketing is definitely putting people off. 

The second and definitely much more radical approach, and is a HUGE stretch, is people bombing to interest percentage. Think about it, how many of you actually rate if you are interested in a movie or not? I know I don‚Äôt. It is plausible that the super small minority of people who took offense to ‚ÄúHer-&gt; A Hero‚Äù and Brie Larson‚Äôs press tour could be a significant portion of the votes. Average people I‚Äôm guessing aren‚Äôt motivated to vote for if they‚Äôre interested in a movie or not, however this small minority could be extremely devoted to lowering this score. I personally think it is a factor but only impacts no more than 15%. 

How much do you think that communities like the Geeks+Gamers community is behind the such low anticipation score on RT?

[NO SPOILERS] How To Train Your Dragon Trilogy,"So I just watched How To Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World yesterday day and I thought it was fantastic, just like the other two.Personally I think these movies are my single favorite trilogy of animated movies ever.

These movies have had such a great atmosphere and I think they do a great job world building. I think that it's also great how the showcase all the different types of people there and how a lot of them would react to the news of people treating the dragons differently.

I've been seeing some people saying that this is the worst one in the series. Personally, my least favorite was HTTYD 2 but that's really not a bad thing. I genuinely believe that all three of these movies are absolutely fantastic and entirely worth watching.

"If you were to cast a film based on performances dating back to 2007, what would that cast be?","I'm just using 2007 as the year to start because I feel as though that was a pretty good year in films overall. Also, you can't pick an actor again for a different performance. You can't pick an actor who has passed away or retired as well.

For example:

2007 - I'm picking Denzel Washington for American Gangster and Matt Damon for The Bourne Ultimatum. Emma Stone in Superbad, Robert Downey Jr. in Zodiac, Josh Brolin in American Gangster, and David Strathairn in The Bourne Ultimatum were good but don't make the cut for me.

2008 - I'm picking Robert Downey Jr. for Iron Man, Rebecca Hall for Vicky Cristina Barcelona, and Mila Kunis for Forgetting Sarah Marshall. This time around, the ones who barely missed the cut for me are Scarlett Johansson in Vicky Cristina Barcelona and Danny McBride in Pineapple Express.

2009 - I'm picking Emma Stone for Zombieland. Barely missing out are Chris Pine in Star Trek, Zoe Saldana in Star Trek, Jeremy Renner in The Hurt Locker, and Anthony Mackie in The Hurt Locker.

2010 - I'm picking Jeremy Renner for The Town. In this year, the honorable mentions would be Amy Adams in The Fighter, Tom Hardy in Inception, and Scarlett Johansson in Iron Man 2.

2011 - To be honest, I'm not taking anyone in this year. Missing out though are Chris Evans in Captain America: The First Avenger, Jennifer Aniston in Just Go With It, and Brad Pitt in Moneyball.

2012 - I'm picking Scarlett Johansson for The Avengers and Tom Hardy for The Dark Knight Rises. Barely missing out would be Mark Ruffalo in The Avengers, Joseph Gordon-Levitt in The Dark Knight Rises, and Jennifer Lawrence in Silver Linings Playbook.

2013 - I'm picking Amy Adams for American Hustle and Michael B. Jordan for Fruitvale Station. Missing out this time are Margot Robbie in The Wolf of Wall Street, Christian Bale in American Hustle, Bradley Cooper in American Hustle, and Robert De Niro in American Hustle.

2014 - I'm picking Chris Pratt for Guardians of the Galaxy and Chris Evans for Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Barely missing out are Bradley Cooper in Guardians of the Galaxy, Anthony Mackie in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Samuel L. Jackson in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Colin Firth in Kingsman: The Secret Service, Taron Egerton in Kingsman: The Secret Service, and Mark Strong in Kingsman: The Secret Service.

2015 - Surprising enough, I'm not taking anyone this year. Honorable mentions though are Idris Elba in Beasts of No Nation, Benicio del Toro in Sicario, and Sylvester Stallone in Creed.

2016 - I'm picking Idris Elba for The Jungle Book and Jennifer Lawrence for Passengers. The honorable mentions are Ryan Gosling in The Nice Guys, Russell Crowe in The Nice Guys, Chadwick Boseman in Captain America: Civil War, Anthony Mackie in Captain America: Civil War, and Chiwetel Ejiofor in Doctor Strange.

2017 - As tough as it is to say this, I'm going with nobody in this year. Tom Holland in Spider-Man: Homecoming, Michael Keaton in Spider-Man: Homecoming, Chris Hemsworth in Thor Ragnarok, Tom Hiddleston in Thor Ragnarok, Tessa Thompson in Thor Ragnarok, Elizabeth Olsen in Wind River, and Ryan Gosling in Blade Runner 2049.

2018 - This is another year where it's tough to not pick anyone but I can't. Near misses are Chadwick Boseman in Black Panther, Andy Serkis in Black Panther, and Tessa Thompson in Creed II.

So overall, my cast would look like:

Denzel Washington, Matt Damon, Robert Downey Jr., Rebecca Hall, Mila Kunis, Emma Stone, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hardy, Amy Adams, Michael B. Jordan, Chris Pratt, Chris Evans, Idris Elba, Jennifer Lawrence

That's pretty stacked so I'd just personally trim it down to get it under 10:

Denzel Washington, Rebecca Hall, Mila Kunis, Emma Stone, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson, Tom Hardy, Michael B. Jordan, Jennifer Lawrence

Still pretty stacked but this is all hypothetical. Eager to hear what you guys all pick/think",movies,1550960797,Stone36,0,0,True,2019-02-23

Have to give it to Hailee Steinfeld, she was fantastic in the movie. Definitely the best female character introduced in all the transformers franchise.

If you look at those classics, crime films were kinda like superhero films of that times (by that I mean famous and overdone). Nobody is not gonna see a Marvel movie.

Can someone help me sort out my feelings about Call Me By Your Name in light of the Bryan Singer accusations?,"I'm having a hard time with this. I loved Call Me By Your Name. I thought the relationship in the movie was touchy, but overall I endorsed it because it seemed to be mutual.

But when I read about the Bryan Singer allegations, it made me question myself. They say that Bryan Singer raped a 17 year old - raped, because at 17 you can't consent because you're underage. And people are horrified about Bryan Singer.

So isn't the relationship in Call Me By Your Name, by that definition, a rape? It's not enough to say it's ""fiction,"" because the people who like the movie don't view it as a ""fictional rape"" story, they view it as a fictional love story. And if it's just because the age of consent is lower in Italy, does that mean that if Bryan Singer lived in Italy he would be acceptable to?

I'm having a hard time with this. To me it seems like you can't have one opinion on one thing and another opinion on the other thing. Obviously one is a movie and one is real life. But it's that no one seems to treat the relationship in Call Me By Your Name as ""rape."" But shouldn't they?

"A quick PSA to all those annoyed by this years Best Picture nominations: Movie nominations are not entirely decided by the strength of a film, but what film a studio chooses to campaign for in award season and thinks has the best behind the scenes message/‚Äúmaking-of‚Äù narrative to engage voters.","That‚Äôs why Black Panther was nominated, not because it was a stronger film than those that were snubbed, but because of what it achieved culturally by making a blockbuster with an all black cast that had nothing to do with tired black stereotypes, but looked to the future of black storytelling.

Likewise with Roma, a late entry that swept up a lot of the nominations.

Biopics vs Documentaries,"Tl;dr; I just want to know other people's takes on biopics, and whether they are particularly good for the film industry.

&amp;#x200B;

So this past year, there have been quite a few high profile biopics. Some of them, I've found, have been really underwhelming, some I've been indifferent/unsure about, and some I've found very good. The big thing for me is, is overly-dramatizing an already remarkable (or controversial in the case of *Vice*) life/story necessary, or would a good ol' fashioned documentary serve the purpose better. For example, did *Bohemian Rhapsody* need to be told in the cinematic manner that it was? They changed a lot of details for the sake of storytelling, and the end product was a so-so melodrama with great musical re-enactments. It seems like a Freddie Mercury documentary would have served its purpose much better in this case, and I'm sure the same people would have gone to see it regardless. Another example of an underwhelming biopic from this year is *The Front Runner.* This movie tells a similar story to that of one of my favorite recent documentaries, *Weiner*. *The Front Runner* unfortunately doesn't hit any real intensity throughout, and probably would have been more enjoyable had it learned a thing or two from *Weiner's* informative, yet engaging story telling. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now I'm not saying that all biopics suck and shouldn't be made. I actually personally like a lot of them. I love *The Social Network, Moneyball,* and *Molly's Game*, and not just because of the Sorkin dialogue. *First Man* was one of my favorites of the year, as I felt it did a good job dramatizing the behind the scenes struggles of astronauts, and was overall just really well done cinematically. *Vice,* while very bold, worked well I think as a biopic in that it was purposeful.

&amp;#x200B;

This post was prompted by me watching *On the Basis of Sex* today. It felt too formulaic, like it was just a cookie-cutter, politically-exploitative biopic. Still, I thought it was enjoyable, but that was probably more down to the fascinating story behind Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I haven't seen RBG yet, but I plan to later. Overall, this post doesn't have too much purpose, and I doubt that anyone has read this far, but I just want to hear some opinions on this.",movies,1548306708,mbkuang,3,1,True,2019-01-24

"White supremacists are brigading BlacKkKlansman threads pretty hard. No, the movie isn't ""anti-white"", it's anti-KKK.","Hundreds and hundreds of comments about how Blackkklansman is racist against white people. Did you even see the movie? Or do you just flock to any thread where you can complain about ""SJWs""?

Here's more about the movie, for those who are only using it as a weapon against anti-racist movies, without actually seeing it:

""The story takes us all the way up the food chain to Duke himself thanks to a cockamamie scheme in which Stallworth continues his phone correspondence with the Klan and sends his colleague, Flip Zimmerman (played by **Adam Driver**)‚Äîwho‚Äôs white and Jewish‚Äîto play ‚ÄúRon Stallworth‚Äù at the Klan meet-ups. Being Jewish isn‚Äôt exactly desirable for the Klan, either, and Zimmerman, whom some members suspect from the start, is at one point pushed to show a Klan member his penis. ‚ÄúI hear you Jews do something weird with your dick,‚Äù says one. ‚ÄúIs your dick circumstanced?‚Äù

But they aren‚Äôt all idiots. As David Duke, Topher Grace, previously best known for playing Eric Forman on *That ‚Äô70s Show,* is just this side of ‚ÄúHi, Neighbor!‚Äù It‚Äôs disconcerting. ‚ÄúEvil can present itself in so many different ways,‚Äù Grace tells me. And indeed, the structure of *BlacKkKlansman*‚Äôs script, as he pointed out, smartly front-loads the first half of the movie with variations on the stereotypical Southern hick, providing a pitch-perfect role for Paul Walter Hauser, for example, who lit up the screen last year, in *I, Tonya,* as Jeff Gillooly‚Äôs idiotic crime conspirator Shawn Eckardt.""

"A Star Is Born (1937), (1954), (1976) &amp; (2018) - A Comparison","I recently saw A Star Is Born (2018) and for the most part enjoyed it. I never seen any other version until the newest one, and I knew there was another version but wondered if it was the same thing or this was something different. I come to realize there are actually four versions of A Star is Born (five if you count the 1910 film). So I decided to watch the other three to see how different they were from each other and why this film keeps being remade. 

&amp;#x200B;

Overall, every movie told the same story, however, with minor differences that did not affect the outcome of the story. Each film dealt with a big star who had an alcohol problem and finds a woman, plucks her out of obscurity and into the limelight. The falling star becomes jealous of her rising fame, but she is undying in her love until his tragic end.

&amp;#x200B;

1937 - It was Norman Maine and Vicky Lester (stage name Esther Victoria). 1954 - It Norman Maine and Vicky Lester. 1976 - It was John Norman Howard and Esther Hoffman. In 2018 - It was  Jack Maine and just Ally. So there is some thread in keeping the name Norman Maine in there, even if not overtly in the latter two films. Ally is the only real deviation from all of the names. 

&amp;#x200B;

Only the 1937 film did not feature a singer, rather a movie star, while 1954, 1979 and 2018 dealt with singing. The 1954 version had a movie celebrity (James Mason) finding a singer (Judy Garland). While the later 2 versions were all about a singer discovering a singer. Barbara Streisand sang in her style that made her famous as did Lady Gaga, while Kris Kristofferson and Bradley Cooper both sported beards and sang a type of country. Cooper having a heavier edge to his music. Judy Garland was more theatrical with musical numbers. Frederic Marc and James Mason were the clean-shaven well-to-do type of men as famous actors.

&amp;#x200B;

They all seemed to have gotten married in a hurry and the female's flight to stardom happened sooner than you realize. 

&amp;#x200B;

Kris Kristofferson's version was the only guy who cheated on his wife. But Streisand seemed to forgive him soon after. All the others remained loyal.

&amp;#x200B;

Each film culminated at the Oscars or Grammys where, while the women were receiving awards, their husbands showed up drunk and made a scene. The scenes became progressively disastrous in each film through the years. Frederic March's drunk was a bit ""spitty"" in his dialogue, but more angry than drunk. In the midst of his diatribe, he flails his arms and accidentally slaps his wife in the face. James Mason, equally angry and more disheveled, comes off a bit more poised in his speech. It's hard to conceive James Mason with his proper British English as someone who would slur his words and bash the language. Similarly, he swings his arms and slaps his wife in the face. Kris Kristofferson's drunk portrayal was similar in his stance, a trip up the stairs, but minus the slap in the face. Here we have the injection of some expletives and more angry at his peers, while the other two pleaded to their peers for work. Bradley Cooper was perhaps the most extreme example as he included pills with his drinking, amplifying the awkwardness when he pissed his pants on stage. While all of the men were dealing with the egos, Kristofferson and Cooper seemed to project their worth onto their peers while March and Mason felt defeated. 

&amp;#x200B;

The suicide is in all of them. The first two ends in a drowning. Supposedly the story came from a real-life incident of a falling star who discovers an actress, and while she becomes famous, he becomes bitter because he could not successfully transition into the talkies. This led him to go swim in the ocean and drown himself. The James Mason version also ends in this manner, feeling rejected by society, he decides his own life is less important than his Vicky's life and take a swim in the ocean. Shot for shot, the 1937 and 1954 version shows a setting sun and he takes his robe off and lays them down on the sand and rocks. We see him swim out and pans to the water washing over the robe. Fade to large headline on the newspaper about his suicide. In 1976 they decided to amp it up a little by giving more time for the audience to prepare for what to come. A long scene driving in the desert in his Corvette until eventually, we discover he crashed somehow. And then in 2018, that might be too over the top where a hanging might be more appropriate for the time period. All the movies seem to be as subtle as possible without actually depicting it. 

&amp;#x200B;

Each film also has an aftermath of how Esther/Vicky/Ally handles it. Both Vicky's of the 1937 and 1954 version realizes she needs to move on as well, but by calling herself after her husbands' name to honor who most people have forgotten and gets a round of applause. ""I am Mrs. Norman Maine."" FADE OUT. The 1976 Esther is announced as ""Esther Hoffman Howard"", now taking her late husbands last name, and then proceeds with a finale and ending on an action still, as seemed popular way to end films in the 70's. In 2018, Ally approaches the stage and says ""Hello, I'm Ally Maine"". Followed by a few words and then a song.

&amp;#x200B;

Only the original version runs less than 2 hours, while the remaining run between two hours and 15 minutes or longer. The Judy Garland version created an alternate version which included scenes originally cut. While they had the original soundtrack, the actual film was missing. So in place, they used stills with the dialogue running over it. 

&amp;#x200B;

In sum, I am not sure why this story keeps being revitalized. It is more of a character study than a timeless theme, as far as I can tell. I enjoyed the 1937 version better than I expected as it stripped the glitz and glamour that the singing versions bring to the table, and focused more on the dynamics of the falling and rising stars. As it is older, the acting is more stagey and the storytelling more pronounced, but it had an authenticity to it. Innocence, perhaps. The latest version was easy to watch. Its slick, polished, vibrant, full of color and wonderful modern music that is easy to digest. But I am not sure its the superior version either. Lady Gaga needed help with acting through some of the editing, but it seemed overshadowed by her singing. Streisand sings very well, as she always has, but I really am not a fan of her style of singing and this movie didn't change my mind either. Judy Garland is more musical numbers than stage performance, which was fine for what it was, but it did not stand out for me as anything special. So for me, I enjoyed the straight forward version from 1937. The Barbara Streisand version probably stands as my least favorite. 

&amp;#x200B;

Why does this film keep getting remade and not Casablanca or Gone With the Wind? Is it permissible because we want to see different stars fail and succeed in the same storyline? Whereas Casablanca is too perfect, caught in time, and to change it would taint the history that it's caught up in? Today's films are all throwaways only to be remade a few years later (see Spider-Man, see Superman, see Batman), while certain films have been hermetically sealed by public devotion keeping it integral. Has home video made filmmaking a disposable commodity? 

&amp;#x200B;

A Star Is Born (if I am correct) is the film with the most remakes of an original story made for film. Only the original won an Academy for Best Screenplay. The 1954 version, while highly rated, was nominated for 6 awards and did not win any. The 1976 version won for Best Song (Evergreen) and was nominated for 3 other awards. While the 2018 release is nominated for 8 categories. We shall see if it reigns as the best of the best.

African movie reccomendation.,"In honour of Zimbabwean music Legend 'Oliver (Tuku) Mtukudzi' who recently passed away, I would like to recommend you guys to watch the Zimbabwean movie Neria. Tuku's most recognized song international is the song 'Neria' ,give it a listen too, it's a very calming song but with deeper meaning if u get what the lyrics mean and then backed up by watching the movie. It's probably the most popular movie ever made in my country. I remember it as the first movie I ever saw, even though as a child I didn't really understand what was happening and all I wanted to see was A bugs life and Lion King. It's a movie that even though it is old, the issue it raised is still there in our society and watching it may give you some unique African perspective.

What Actually Makes a Good Movie?,"Everyone has different tastes and opinions on things. Some people want deep and meaningful film, where the viewer is forced to think and reflect on events and ideals within the movie (indie, drama, art house, Oscar films), meanwhile others would rather just watch something to shut their brains off for a few hours (straight entertainment, popcorn movie). I think very few people can actually see the appeal in both sides. Meanwhile what actually makes a good movie? Box office numbers obviously don't but what allows a standard popcorn movie to break the bounds and also be considered a good movie by tougher movie critics? 

For me it's personally story, characters, and impact... what did the story tell me? Did the characters make me feel something and help to deliver the story's message? And how has this film impacted me personally and am I thinking about things after the credits have rolled?

The ending of BlackKkKlansman pissed me off,"I lost it at the end. Trump's speech defending violent protesters triggered me beyond measure. I'm not usually the type to catch feelings over stuff like that, but, that really struck a deep chord. I can't believe I heard that come out of our leader. What got me off-guard was that I forgot about that car going full speed into the crowd, I couldn't understand why. The movie itself was great and everything about it was foreshadowing the violence coming. I went back to thinking why I forgot about that car ramming into protesters, I failed to realize I forgot about so many other underlying issues our country is facing with all this racial tension that is still real and still very relevant. It hurt me to think others are out there, right now, still caught up on hating someone for a different pigmentation of the skin. The silver lining of this movie portrayed Ron's character perfectly for me. Ron had to kill his feelings and sacrifice pride and dignity to succeed. It was too real. Idk this is just my rambling. I really recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of crime dramas, it has it all. The main actor stole the show in every scene.

would come to the conclusion that these women are weak and not able to take care of themselves?

"Which, for you, is the most overrated movie of this decade?","For me, it's Black Panther (10 Oscar nominations, including best picture nod). I understand that the academy awards are not an absolute parameter to judge films released that year. It's unrealistic to select the best from many great films, but at least the nominations should have the best films released that year, films that really push the envelope.   

I fail to see why Black Panther is an important film. Plot is contrived and formulaic. Even VFX are crappy in a few scenes. The film has successfully disguised itself as a cultural phenomenon, but in actuality, it's a cheap shot at cashing in on identity politics. It's not art, but a corporate product, made by probably the biggest film studio in the world.    

Academy is either dumb enough to not see through it or worse, also cashing in (not literally) on the hype.

P.S. I loved when an indie film Moonlight won over La La Land, also when Get Out got nominated and won in deserved categories. Academy should give power to such films.

It's a SUPER distinctive voice, and is clear as day (aka not disguised in any way). I note that it's clearly well-known character actor Leland Orser (trust me, you know his voice).

It's such a beautiful film that's why I wanted to share it with you guys on reddit. I searched for a discussion here on r/movies but I found nothing.

(I copied this summary from the Hollywood report if anyone is interested in watching the film; ""the film is largely set on the island of Fernando Poo (now called Bioko) during the declining years of its colonization by the Spanish. Mostly delivered via flashback, it follows the discovery by the young, idealistic Clarence (Adriana Ugarte) of a fragment of an old letter which shows that her aging, addled uncle Killian (Celso Bugallo) has been secretly despatching money to an island family. Despite the advice of her mother, the older Julia (Petra Martinez) not to go, Clarence turns up in the tropics and in true postcolonial style, she‚Äôll learn that what‚Äôs been going on under the apparently benign surface is actually rather horrible.""

I suppose this is the start of the promotional campaign and a teaser trailer will premiere in early February.

Best version of Terminator 2: Judgment Day to get?,[removed],movies,1548358121,mtbatey,0,1,True,2019-01-24
Best version of Terminator 2 to get?, I have an old DVD of T2 that I want to upgrade to a Blu Ray however there seem to be quite a few options out there and none seem to be getting good reviews. Is there a version on Blu Ray that you would consider to be the definitive version? Is there one that has both the theatrical and extended cut on it?  Do most have the same special features like behind the scenes?  Any of them have commentary tracks?  Just looking to see what the best version is.,movies,1548358404,mtbatey,15,1,True,2019-01-24
"To anyone that has watched Green Book, do you think it could be a good date movie?","So I asked out this girl from my writing class on a (second) date and suggested Bohemian Rhapsody. She said it she'd already seen it but could see it again. I thought that sounded a bit boring for her though. So now I'm looking to other movies to go and see, and saw that Greenbook was playing at a local theatre. I really don't know that much about it other than imdb says it's a comedy drama, so kind of a neutral genre. But I want to ask anyone that has seen it, would you think it's a good date movie or should I go for something else? ",movies,1548358562,Lexglore,15,1,True,2019-01-24

Who are some actors who‚Äôs appearances in a movie ruins the film for you?,"This could be due to bad acting or that their style has just become old and boring. For me Ryan Renyolds whole shtick has gotten so old and brutal to watch it really take me out of the whole movie viewing experience.
