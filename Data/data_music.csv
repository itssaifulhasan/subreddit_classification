Audioslave Like A Stone 2003 Rock,"I‚Äôve been told by mods I need at least 50 words for a post to *post* so here we go. 

The theme of death and the permanence of death is so heavy in these lyrics I can‚Äôt believe no one had reached out to Chris before his suicide. 
I‚Äôm aware that no other member of this band is qualified to diagnose mental health issues but this one kind of kicks you in the teeth as a listener so I can‚Äôt even begin to imagine what recording this song was like professionally. 

The outstanding and absolute sadness of these lyrics are so bleak. 
Saying I understand what a ‚Äúcry for help means‚Äù is like saying I know what the birds mean when they caw. But *someone* had to have understood what Chris was trying to express. And this is not the only instance of super melancholy lyrics. 

‚ÄúNail in my head from my creator, you gave me life now show me how to live.‚Äù

Take that line apart and it‚Äôs so terrible about how this person was feeling.

Agree or not, the lyrics stand for what he meant. He put so much time and effort into having them heard for whatever reason but, in my understanding, it seems like no one was really hearing what he was saying.",Music,1584588337,RolandLovecraft,8,4,True,2020-03-18

Bruce Springsteen is an underrated gem and Thunder Road is easily in the top 10 greatest songs of all time.,"I thought a post like this would hopefully gain attraction here and pick up steam.

Title says it all really. The Boss IMO is one of the greats. There is something about his music I think that just connects with the teenage experience. Growin Up, For you, Backstreets, Racing in the Street,  and You can look (but you better not touch) just have something about them that make them unseprable from the experience of teenagers. The entire River album is great, and so is Something in the night. Badlands and The Promised land are great peices and on the river (album) The River (song) weaves a sad sad tale in a beautiful way and Cadillac Ranch just brings to mind when you would get the lads in one car and go for a drive. Born in the USA is one of 3 albums to have 7 songs reach the top 10, and the title track I would say is the second best Vietnam war song, losing to only fortunate son. The Nebraska album is id say his second best work. Him, a harmonica, and his guitar. Reason to Believe and My fathers house are the boss at his best. And now to his greatest work (IMO) Born to run. The title track is awesome, and Tenth Avenue Freeze out, Jungleland, and backstreets are amazing. But all of those combined to not quite reach the level that I think Thunder road is on.


Thunder road is in the top 10 greatest songs of all time. And specifically [this](https://youtu.be/YgRC8n2zuHY) one from the live 75-85 album. It's him, harmonica ,piano, and bells and its is absolulty amazing. The entire song is amazing. It's just a man, asking for a chance, a chance with a girl he truly wants with all his heart, and its beautiful. And I don't understand why A: he's not more popular, and B: why his work isn't more highly regarded. I want you to listen to that song, and tell me that Bees Gees staying alive (a song which is always in the top 10 in any x greatest songs of all time list) is a better piece of music than THAT. Because its not. His songs are something that many other songs arnt: they are relatable. Bohemian Rhapsody is a great song, but you gotta really intrept the meaning. Guess what? Everyones been a teenager, everyone has thought they found ""the one"", everyone has grown up and gotten older.  I really don't know what else to say except go and listen to him, hes great and you totally should.

Bandcamp will donate their cut of profits to musicians for all purchases made on March 20th 2020 (tomorrow),"I haven‚Äôt seen any posts about this at all. But the artists you love are suffering from this pandemic as much as you and I are, if not more. Tomorrow, (March 20th, 2020) Bandcamp has decided to donate its cut of profits directly to artists. I know this is a difficult time for all of us. But if you have the extra money to support your favorite artists, Im sure they would appreciate this. 

Personally if i saw this post i would think it was an ad, i tend to not trust anything on reddit that is even remotely related to a company. I can give nothing but my own word, but im not a fuckin corporation. The artists that both you and i love are struggling, and i felt the need to share this, to maybe offer some help.

"Am I insane, or is there not a single good stereo remaster of Revolver?","I'm going to preface this post with the following statement: I do not consider myself an audiophile, but if you played a 128kbps mp3 for me on a $35 or $35,000 system I would bitch, moan, leave the room, and tell you to fuck off. 

Is there not a single copy of Revolver mixed for stereo that doesn't suck???
Every single copy i can find is just...not good. It's like they just figured out it was recorded on separate tracks and went nuts separating things. There is just so much separation its crazy. Vocals and piano exclusively on the right, guitar exclusively on the left. Its wild.

All the streaming platforms have the same digital rip, which is terrible.

I recently picked up PC 7009 on vinyl and it's the same mix (essentially). 

I know The Beatles are insane in general, but does anyone have a recommendation for me that isn't terrible for listening to Revolver on headphones??? Like why is Elanor Rigby harmonized on both channels for the bridge and chorus but not the verses? It's just super weird and imo sounds terrible.

The mono rip of the '66 pressing is great, but it totally needs a remaster.

Let's kill this quarantine boredom with some midnight dancing!,"As the title says, I am looking for people to join online for a midnight dance party. (I'm living in California :) but you can join from anywhere). If you're feeling low, bored or just want to talk and see more people around you, get your dance shoes on (haha not literally), hop on some cool pjs (very literally), and dance it out to some oldies music (not a necessity, just something I'm in the mood for). This is most fun if we're doing it on video, watching each other break the moves and living to the fullest for some time. You don't need to be any good in dancing. Actually, on the contrary, the more casual the better. I am looking to start with some songs I have in mind (80s, 90s music) and hoping people can then suggest their own tracks. I am doing this for the first time, so let's see how this goes. It was a really random, spontaneous thought I had while looking at people around my place, trying to kill their boredom somehow. Hope to cheer some people up and just have some simple fun! Alright, so that's it people. Hit me up if you're interested what you'd like to dance to.

Question about music genre and music suggestions,"How would you define the genre of music listed bellow? I am searching for more of this style.  
It reminds me a bit of Chill-step (vocal) with its ambient beats and chorus.  
1. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aozn7J\_avU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Aozn7J_avU)  


Since we are at it. How would you define this below? Author of this mashup states it is Metal x EDM and some call it also EMD mashup, however i can not find anything similar that would be as enjoyable. Really love this style of glitch music where there is a lot of stuff happening with different sounds and soundtrack still keeps well defined melody with all the glitches. Original comes from Skrillex - Bangarang, however i do not like it unfortunately. As stated above, for me the original is too much sub-bass (Dubstep i believe it is called) and too little melody and sound variety.

So I've been watching a lot of these investigative YouTube channels (scaretheater, inside a mind, etc). There's this one song that for some reason has been stuck in my head for the past few days and I have no idea what it is. I'm pretty sure that I heard it on one of those channels.

What I know about the song: I know the melody very well. The chord progression is (c minor, c minor, g# minor, g minor). It is played on a piano and the audio sounds slightly degraded (it sounds like a very slight low pass filter was put on it). The song is in roughly 80 BPM, or 160 depending on how you look at it.

"What do you call this kind of music used in movie trailers, and the sounds/techniques used?","I'm not a musician nor any kind of expert, but I'm guessing someone here knows something about this, because I'm scrambling for the words to describe the genre and sounds of movie scores, especially the music used in trailers for epic/action/adventure movies of the last ten years or so.

Especially looking for the term used, if there is one, for the orchestral music becoming dramatically muffled/muted, then swelling and then culminating in a really strong timpani or echoing snare drum hit. (That's my best guess for the percussion used.)

If the music isn't just a generic classical-ish orchestral score, the music will often be a dramatic cover of a well-known song with a cinematic score behind it. It'll be given a slow, strong beat to make it sound more epic, but if there are vocals, they will be intentionally, choked/weak.

If the music is for something that definitely leans toward action/war, it will often be several percussion hits in a rapid succession followed by music with no percussion.

Disney does this *a lot* and their variation of it will usually be uplifting/heartwarming, but it can also be more warlike and sinister with a slight adjustment. It's always shooting for *EPIC FEELS* no matter what.

Here are some examples.

Dolittle:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hej47fWFLQs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hej47fWFLQs)

Top Gun: Maverick:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flURw76\_UCU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flURw76_UCU) (This one actually uses a sonic boom at the end instead of an instrument because subtlety.)

What's weird is that I feel like no one listens to this music. Even movie scores will often be enjoyable removed from the context of their movies, and they usually have a distinct genre, usually classical.

But movie trailers seem to have this unique mongrel genre of movie score crossed with arena rock and pop. Most people seem to get what I'm talking about when I explain this in detail, but I don't really have words for it.

To the degree that people produce hypothetical trailer music:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4wrph1TrTU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4wrph1TrTU) /  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBgmBDyvyuQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OBgmBDyvyuQ) /  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPhcJTTz\_Fs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YPhcJTTz_Fs)

"[Opinion/Discussion] Recent controversy of Eminem referencing Manchester Bombing, and the changing landscape of what is acceptable in entertainment.","Good morning Reddit,

I was reading a number of users thoughts on the following lines from the song Unaccommodating off of his new album ""Music To Be Murdered By"":

""But I‚Äôm contemplating yelling ‚ÄúBombs away‚Äù on the game
Like I‚Äôm outside of an Ariana Grande concert waiting""[1]

There has been a large backlash for these lines, stating they're pointless, insensitive, and can act as a trigger for those connected with the event. There has also been a lot of discussion about the use of the explosion sound effect that immediately follows the line.

There has also been a number of comments that would share their interpretations of the line, believing there is a positive benefit in bringing awareness to an incident. Many users also attempted to show how Eminem's discography had contained numerous references to incidents such as these and that the shock people are experiencing is misplaced.

I believe the line regarding the Manchester Bombing [2] is receiving so much attention in comparison to other references to his music is because who the target of that attack was - Ariana Grande concert goers. Another element in this is his use of the explosion sound effect that immediately follows the line. If the reference didn't act as enough of a trigger for someone, the explosion sound could.

While thinking about this topic last night, I started to look at the situation in a different light that presents a larger issue. Before getting into it, I wanted to mention backlash received by Eminem in 2018 for his use of gunshot and explosion sound effects in his concerts [1]. This backlash was noted as being a product of increasing gun violence and fear surrounding mass shootings and terrorism. This is when I began to realize that we're shifting to a culture where young civilians in developed countries are experiencing levels of fear and PTSD of what you would expect from being in a war zone. 

I'm curious about people's thoughts on this matter, not so much on the artist or the lines themselves, but on the everyday concert goers, generally middle-class teens, living in a culture of fearing that at any moment your innocent night out could turn into a mass shooting or explosion, as well as what the healthiest ways of responding to this shift in culture could possibly be. 

Thank you for reading and I'm looking forward to reading your responses, 

Sam

How do I try to begin and progress a band,"
So like I‚Äôm 14 and I play drums, therefore have no indication how to ‚Äúform‚Äù a sound, which is not that bad because I‚Äôm planning on learning a guitar as well 

I‚Äôm in a ‚Äúband‚Äù but we just kinda play one song every now and then, it consists of me (drums) my friend (guitarist) and my other friend (pianist) and a bassist who like doesn‚Äôt really play because they just started bass . 

I feel like we‚Äôve never progressed due to our differences in music taste and we‚Äôve barely ever reached a common ground and with a pianist, me and the guitarists songs have to be changed to fit them in. 

However.... 

I‚Äôve been playing in a different school for a community band because the school has no percussionists, and I‚Äôve met 2 bass players (which bugs me because I know 4 bass players but 1 guitar player wtf) and although they‚Äôre a year or so higher than me I‚Äôd like to one day try and start a band with them (because our tastes in music conform with each other) 

So what I‚Äôm asking for here is 

1) should I just wait and become friendlier with the band people from a different school and have hopes to maybe start a band. Or buck through with my current band and try to push us onwards 

2) any tips for developing a sound for whatever band I end up in

I'm trying to quantise music using population statistical analysis. Help me develop the idea and data.,"

Enjoying music is basically abusing our best tool that is pattern recognition, prediction and improvisation (like bayes conditional probability) of trial and error information obtained via experience which has so far helped us in the wild during our hunter-gatherer phase. Now since the environment turned safer we use that as a luxury.

My idea is that the fact that we enjoy music shows how limited our brain is (just a survival instinct machine trying to guess how far and fat the predator is by hearing the rumble off of the ground).That is we are limited to the proper details (without wide approximation) of small numbers and short spans of time.

As a thought experiment...If we are asked to compare the numbers 1 million and 1 billion. It makes more sense to us about how far off those two numbers are if we take them in seconds and convert to small analogues like 11 days and 32 years respectively. Also the human touch in music is centered around the 'feel' or more specifically the loose but tight playing style (bonzo drum https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lWnhz1ZcF74 )...Which in mathematical terms is the click is limited perfectly in a bar and it varies in milliseconds within each click in a bar (in that video, there is also the weight of each hit or the way he's holding the drumsticks, etc adding to the beauty but taking all that in would be difficult, so im gathering information in bits) .¬†

As a start I'm trying to find out just how many milliseconds variation is there (and once thats in, then layer by layer add further complexities) and how much is the limit beyond which we feel it is offbeat using population statistical analysis and interpret the data to find out the standard deviation of different samples from various countries.¬†

I'm also guessing it has something to do with how self awareness evolved. Both have a common theme that is pattern recognition which has to be perfect as because of the delay in processing information we wouldn't be able to enjoy music. Example, if the hi-hat goes silent in between we still would be able to keep track of rhythm in a complex composition and still feel mind blown by the awesomeness and it might just give us an insight on how various centres of our brain are linked since these spikes seem to be evoking emotions, memories(false and experienced) , just want the data to come in.",Music,1576811294,vishnutvm,3,1,True,2019-12-19

My review of - 'It's Christmas Time' - (Macklemore) What does everyone else think??,"With Christmas just around the corner, it only makes sense that the time of year would demand an overhaul from the entertainment industry for its performers to advocate for such a joyous event. Amongst those who have in some way expanded the ever-growing representation of Christmas through their music is Macklemore with his brand new release, ‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Christmas Time‚Äô featuring vocals from Dan Caplen. 

The name Macklemore has never been one to remain as simply just one thing. His major breakthrough into the world of stardom back in the early 2010s completely shook the hip hop scene, as Macklemore used a stroke of quirkiness to dismantle the core standards of rap, being credited by many as a stroke of genius. As time passed, the world seemingly didn't have the same demand it once had for a fresh-faced, goofy, white guy in Macklemore, but he certainly never lost any of the character that was ultimately the foundation to his come up. That genius that had unhinged the world of pop had dwindled into a state of corniness that many found a turnoff and a statement of illegitimacy to his music and his brand. 

‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Christmas Time‚Äô at heart is the charm of Macklemore and even more of that corniness he is so heavily associated with wrapped into a seasonal anthem in which the performers reminisce of their innocence and childhood magic of Christmas. Lyrically, the track does everything it possibly can to inject Christmas themed imagery and associated elements within pop culture to evoke the ‚ÄòChristmas spirit‚Äô, a tribute to the commercial oversaturation of near every Christmas song. The lyrics present are so vague the track lacks any sense of personal connection or value, removing the sentimental element and weakening the idea of personal childhood innocence Macklemore tries to achieve. The only time in which the track truly feels like a song shaped by Macklemore‚Äôs experience is when he shouts out his dead dog, a personal and endearing note but such a bizarre and morbid way to paint conflicting imagery. 

Whilst the track struggles to feel like it holds any significance to Macklemore in a personal sense, it evidently screams involvement from Macklemore as an artist. In regards to the delivery of his vocal performance, the track rings like a Macklemore level of effort to its core. The phrasing is so dreary and given in such a druggy state. The slow pacing of the song during his verses is set up to allow Macklemore‚Äôs personalised story to hit with meaning and connect with audiences, but it instead comes off as a painful joke song in which Macklemore sounds more uninterested and uninspired than ever. Vocally, Macklemore even loses his comedic flair, with his raspy and low energy voice sounding far more like a performance by G-Eazy. On a track where all the targets are set up for Macklemore‚Äôs corniness to shine through, he misses the mark on near every chance he has. The featured vocalist, Can Caplen, adds next to nothing to the track on his appearances during the choruses and the outro. A vocal effort that is completely derived of any character or charm, the track hits an unpleasant lull during his time on the record. What was most likely his attempted incorporation of vocal techniques to strengthen the emotive tone of the song comes off as poor annunciation and a sense of a lifeless performance, that never had any intention of benefitting the song. 

Production-wise, the track sees the variety of iconic Christmas jingles and jangles spread throughout it to establish the dominant festive tone. The subtle percussive instrumentation used to evoke the sense of Christmas is by in large the weakest element of the production on the track. It is instead the horns that are introduced in the choruses that manage to bring a flair of life and interest to the track. The full sound in the horns provides a level of warmth, triumph, and joy that is unmatched by any other element within the song. The track's outro introduces an acoustic guitar refrain that plays the song out, this marks the return of an unimaginative and uninspired sound that spoils the song, this time even removing the trademark musical nods to Christmas. 

‚ÄòIt‚Äôs Christmas Time‚Äô is simply yet another attempt by a mainstream artist to capitalise on an overly eager market to buy into the Christmas scandal. Macklemore‚Äôs track neither represents or adds anything to an ever-growing catalog of songs created within the ‚ÄòChristmas spirit‚Äô. Beyond the initial veil and scraping aside the obvious cash grab nature of the song, in which its existence is purely spawned from capitalising on the time of year, the song is easily one of Macklemore‚Äôs most uninspired. Removing all sense of character and personalisation, Macklemore keeps all his corniness and absolutely none of the charm of inventiveness he once held. Upon first listen, and ultimately any others that pursue the initial taste of the song, the track is masqueraded to sound like almost a parody or joke type song that is critiquing the content and standards of Christmas songs within modern years, but in thinking as such, listeners would be crediting the artists behind this lifeless mess with far too much praise and self-awareness. The track is one that will inevitably be swallowed up and forgotten come the passing of the current Christmas season, as a song, it was never invented or created with the expectation to have a shelf life, and as a Christmas song, it fails on most fronts to bring anything new or interesting to the sub-genre.",Music,1576813265,RedHeadReviews,0,1,True,2019-12-19

What are the legal implications of being an artist marketplace platform that encourages the private sale of personalized cover song performances?,"Hello, r/Music!

THE QUESTION:

What are the legal implications of being an artist marketplace platform that encourages the private sale of personalized cover song performances?

CONTEXT:

I'm a musician and E-commerce professional that is launching a marketplace soon for artists to make money from home selling personalized video and audio recordings of cover songs (learn more about it [here](https://forms.omnisrc.com/signup/v1/5df99a1d4c7fa40dd802c661_5df9a16599f0b774ce6065cb.html)) . I'm currently seeding the platform with artists (the website is not open yet), and want to get things straight before opening the doors.  


While the artists have full control over which songs they cover, I would want to know that I, as the platform founder, am protected from legal action in the inevitable case where I'm sued because of content sold from my platform that violates copyright law or some degree of fair use laws. I'd also want to be able to protect the artists on the platform within any terms and conditions that I can within affordability and reason.

As far as ‚Äòfair use‚Äô of cover songs go, it‚Äôs quite a low impact case in that it's one recording, one download of that one recording, and would have elements to it that separate it from the pack, as a homemade musical gift rather than a polished produced streaming ready release...but are there are still composition royalties we may need to pay per copy of the song; in that case, it might be like 10c a file paid out; I‚Äôd have to factor that into my costs. But as a platform  where someone could easily upload a record, that is sold through the platform, and then is downloaded and posted online, goes crazy viral, and some major record company goes after the artist in a lawsuit and/or they go after me too just because they can,‚Ä¶super lame. Trying to avoid that. I could write terms and conditions for consumers and for artists in relation to the platform; and artists could write their own terms and conditions for their customers.  


Also what legal responsibilities do I have to consider? I may be able to pay a 1 time royalty at time of purchase on behalf of my artists ([https://www.harryfox.com/#/](https://www.harryfox.com/#/)) but with sync licenses, or who knows what else...overall....I think I need a lawyer haha any name drops or suggestions?

This is a genre I remember I really loved and was into a while back, but because I discovered other genres that I enjoyed more than alt-rock at the time, I lost interest in the genre and listened to it less. Now the reverse is happening, and I‚Äôm starting to gain more interest in alt-rock while losing some interest in genres that I‚Äôm into currently. Any recommendation is greatly appreciated!

"Fairytale Of New York is not a nice, happy, Christmas song, and here's the reason why...","\*Long Essay Contextualising The Lyrical Genius of Fairytale Of New York Ahead, Don't Say I Didn't Warn You, You'll Never Hear It The Same Again\*

The song is an argument being portrayed between two people (portrayed in the video and song as drunk, and aggressive). Let's look at the two characters the singers are putting forward (and yes, they are characters, and not the singers singing as themselves).

He's a drunk, who gambles away their money (""Got on a lucky one, Came in eighteen-to-one""). HE's not pleasant to be around and regularly ends up in ""The Drunk Tank"" (AKA a separate jail cell that people who are intoxicated get put in if they are causing trouble).

She's a woman stuck in a marriage that she doesn't want to be in, he promised her the world and delivered empty promises when he got her in to his bed (When you first took my hand On a cold Christmas Eve, You promised me Broadway Was waiting for me) and (""You took my dreams from me, When I first found you"") She is stuck hating him but dealing with the relationship since back in that time you would probably be socially disowned for leaving a relationship (Lets place this song in the 50's-60's since they reference Frank Sinatra's swing music ""Sinatra Was Swinging""). 

He calls her a ""slut on junk"", so she calls him a ""scumbag"", ""maggot"" and ""faggot"". Now i'm not saying its a good word to use, but contextually it makes sense.  If you watch the music video they are fighting, and visibly hitting each other. It's not a jovial throwing about of words. It's almost a cry for help. They don't like each other, they are both being abusive towards each other, for the reasons I previously mentioned.

Ok, so there's an argument to be had about how much the general public enjoy yelling the scumbag maggot bit, and how out of context it's not really okay to yell the word ""faggot"" since its used so often as a slur. But in the context of the song, it makes sense. Neither of the 'characters' being portrayed by the singers are nice people. Hence their choice of language. They wouldn't consider the meaning of the word, they are just hurling insults at each other.

So one more thing. The whole song is the guy looking back on what he has done with regret. He is behind bars on Christmas eve for fighting drunkenly with his wife (presumably at the pub) and he 'turns his face away' and dreams that he hadn't done any of the things that he then goes on to sing about. There's even an argument that he may have done something serious that would result in a long prison sentence since the old man is telling him 'won't see another one"".

There's a lot hidden in this song, and if you look deeper than just those one or two lines that everyone loves to sing there's a clever dark and rather sad lyrical tale to be told, and that's what makes it a great song.",Music,1576837003,JamesHarriman,0,1,True,2019-12-20

Earphones vs Headphones,"While this post may jump around, I‚Äôll try to narrow it down. How does an audiophile compare headphones to earphones? I recently upgraded from Ink‚Äôd Wireless to a pair of PowerBeats 3 (Groupon for the win). Immediately I can tell the difference. I can differentiate between minute details better and find new sounds within the music I listen to. My only complaint with earphones and headphones are that they tend to not be as comfortable for me due to sensitive ears. I am currently trying to find the best ear tips due to the sensitivity of my ear canals and ears as a whole but I digress.

My question arose after driving 16hrs straight after working 6 hrs at a remote location (only stopping for gas and gas station pizza), I came home to find my new headphones have arrived. Dead tired, I charged them for five minutes to give them a whirl. The song I chose to listen to, to get an impression on whether I like them was ‚ÄúHung up on my Baby‚Äù by Isaac Hayes. Immediately I could hear more within the percussion, and could hear sounds that would otherwise appear to be hidden again I digress. 

Any input or comments would be great to satiate my curiosity.

It just came out that way naturally and I fully embraced that feeling until the very end of the project.

I guess we as artists should start embracing the fact that we aren't just 1 person with 1 personality, but a whole lot of different personalities/individuals packed into 1 vehicle/body.

Music in the 2010s,"
This decade was in all honesty pretty forgettable as far as music is concerned. Of course, I don't mean that there was no good music released this decade, because there was a plethora of good songs and a handful of masterpieces. But just like the '00s, nothing truly stood out in a way that drastically changed the music scene the way the '90s and the decades that preceded it did.

This might sound like I'm being too negative, because I don't want this statement to be taken that way, as I found a great deal of enjoyment in so many songs this decade, and there was definitely plenty of groundbreaking music.

I shall list my Top 30 songs of the decade. These songs are ranked based on a combination of many factors, namely, how haunting/impactful they were on my music listening experience, in other words, how they shaped this decade musically for me, how groundbreaking I think they are within their respective genres, and more importantly, how much I enjoyed and played them and how much they resonated with me (in the case of those that did).

Guy with a long red hair, or blonde  
Video seems to be between 80's-90's

Pia Nopuente - What It feels to Love [R&amp;B/Pop],"Hello guysss!

Im a newbie here. I just want to share to you my first single What It Feels to Love. You can listen to it via Youtube, Spotify, iTunes and etc. :)  I hope you all listen to it and kindly give me some feedback in how to improve my music in the future.

Well here's just s short background story of the song.

I wrote the song 10 years ago. I just love singing but I don't know how to play instruments well, just a little bit of Guitar. I met with some friends and started to sing to the song to them, and received positive feedback's from them. Fortunately they know some people who knows how play different kinds of instruments. And we started to jam in a near studio where we can rent instruments. That was one of the happiest day in my life because we were able to bring my song to life. Unfortunately, we we're not able to record it. I lost hope at that time.

But just recently independent musician or undiscovered musician started to emerged in the music industry, and it gave me confidence to release the song.

I hired a sound engineer/Arranger of the song and help me with the music, I sang the song in acapella for him to know what instruments/beat we need. The sound engineer was so good and also boost my self-confidence in singing. He is also the sound-engineer  of ""Kahit Ayaw Mo Na"" by This Band and earned him a recognition in 2019 Awit Awards.

I recorded the song when it was just a draft tune.

After two weeks of working on the song we were able to finished it! And I am so happy.

But at the same time, I am hurt, because of the people who envied me.. and telling me my song will never make it to the mainstream. And to me it does not matter. All the matters to me was I am contented with the song and my dream is for the world to know it! Thank you so much for taking time reading this. Godbless us all!",Music,1574230104,leech02,1,1,True,2019-11-20

Froggie went a courtin',"Hey Reddit, I was hoping you could help me. 
When I was a little girl my grandfather would sit me on his knee and would sing along to froggie went a courtin', well now as a adult I look back on those memories fondly but for years I've been trying to find the version he would play for me. Every version I find is  a higher pitched voice, banjo or just not what I'm looking for. The version he played for me was a deep voice, a deep guitar and was sung not fast but not slow. There was humming and it was a gorgeous song. He's convinced it is Johnny cash but I'm just trying to find this song so when my grandfather does pass away I can have this song to remember him by.

Hey everyone! 

On Fridays I teach alternative high school students an elective course called ""Music in Society."" We look at specific artists/genres of music and assess their societal impact. We also analyze how society at large has responded to a genre of music over time. 

This Friday, we are looking at metal music (no specific subgenre) I was looking for recommendations of metal artists that you think have been controversial or specific events that you think would be good to mention. Thanks for any help and recommendations!

So I believe that this new style has really bright future! Kristika - PIN,"A brief description of the style from its creator, sound designer, beatmaker and producer Dmitry Shnayder: ‚ÄúThe Three-beat‚Äù style was being developed during 8 years with few short breaks. Its main difference is that the beat size has a cycle of 3 kicks instead of the usual 4. The most difficult thing was to make the beat comfortable for the listener, because namely this beat has its own extraordinary characteristics. It means that many other beatmakers will have to puzzle over if they would like to be able to repeat it.  A lot of musicians were previously doing something different - 4 kicks, but only with triplets. And we‚Äôve decided to turn everything upside down. Pay attention - in our music there are no triplets. The usual hat (hi-hat) is at the second beat. But there are just 3 kicks! Nowadays this is a completely new approach. It is the real experiment that showed great flexibility in its applying in various directions, even in rap and rock music! So I believe that this new style has really bright future!   Enjoy your listening!

Scientific  findings show that stress is the basic cause of 60% of all human  illness and disease. It increases the risks of HEART DISEASE by 40%;  HEART ATTACK by 25% and STROKE by 50%.

The  bad news is that you are exposed to stress every single day through  your interactions with other people, your thoughts and your work.

But  here is the good news: listening to music you enjoy decreases levels of  the stress hormone cortisol in your body.

WTF? A writer's block!,"***Easiest ways to deal with a writer's block: 3 tips***  
This is for everyone who writes and creates his own music. We all struggle with the famous 'writer's block' every now and then. So I figured, why not share my personal hacks to deal with any writer's block. I've had a lot in my life, but since the last 2 years I found a way to handle them pretty well.

**Tip 1: distract your brains**  
When we have a writer's block, the problem is that we're stuck in our minds. The solution is to get out of your mind. Some people take a walk, take a shower, take a shit or do some shopping. Yes, this helps.

This helps because you ""bend"" your mind into not thinking about the song you're writing, you're actually ""distracting"" your brain. You're fooling it by making it think about something completely different. See it as your ""creation-muscle"", that's the muscle you need to write songs and lyrics. When the muscle gets overstretched it wil overstress and all that muscle wants to do is relax.

So, go outside, do something different for at least two hours, to be totally away from your work, and than you'll notice the difference immediately when you jump back on your project. 

If that doesn't work, and you're really eager to create music (against nature's will): work on another track/song/production. For instance, I once had a deadline. I had to deliver a soundtrack for a podcast. I only had one afternoon left, but still I took the risk and started to work on another project. I needed the other project to get inspired for the ""writer's block song"". When I, two hours before deadline, opened up my ""writer's block song"", it just rolled out my head and I could finish it up easily. Time pressure too, helped in this case. You don't have more time, you have a deadline, that's when your brain gets really creative. It's natural, trust your brain!

**Tip 2: clean your room/studio**  It may sound clich√©, but a clean room/studio means a clean head. This also goes for people that work in rooms full of stuff: there's always a way of organizing that stuff, without throwing it out of the window. Clean up your workspace, it will help you clean up your mind to be creative again.

Remember when you were a kid, and you used to change the entire interior of your bedroom? We'd move the bed to different spot, move our toys to another wall, get our desk centered in the room instead of in a corner: this always gave me inspiration. It's really good to clean up your work area, make a fresh cup of coffee, and get to work. I'm not saying you should re-install your equipment, just dusting it of. Like a 'clean desk policy'. 

**Tip 3: write a storyline before rhyming**  To me this is the BEST tip I've ever had. When we write lyrics, most of the time tend to look for words that rhyme. This is tricky. Sometimes a rhyme word may sound good, but it does not add up to the story we're writing. And what does that give us? Lyrics that rhyme, but don't really appeal, what you actually saying? Most of the time the rhymeword takes your story by the hand, and all of a sudden you're stuck in the story, because you don't know where it's heading.

For instance, a verse that I have here. I wrote it just because it rhymed.      
*I'm all alone up in my room*  
*I don't know what to do*  
*She left me for another guy*  
*My oh my, why did I have to*  
*Cheat on her, cheat on her*  
*I don't have a clue*  
*Why I did it, I don't know*  
*I'm stuck inside the truth*

These lyrics RHYME, but these lyrics SUCK, because it's vague and generic, plus it's not a very visual story, the words don't really come to life: they rhyme, but that's it. Therefor I always start to write a storyline. Before I come up with ""what rhymes"" I create the mood, the storyline. For instance:

*The song I'm writing today is about a dude (me-perspective) who cheats on his girl. He regrets it, confesses to her and she dumps him. Later he sees her in a restaurant, dining with her new boyfriend. He's sure about it: he's going to win her heart back and he's willing to do everything for it. In the end he convinces her of his love and they end up together.*

Now, if we start writing lyrics, it's way easier to find the words, because we actually know where our story is leading. If we don't know that, we let words that rhyme take control over the story. Let's rewrite the lyrics from above and create some warmth, with the storyline given and see if it's more 'visible' or the listeners.

*Stuck here in an empty room				 I'm all alone up in my room*    
*My head is filled with the thought of you		 I don't know what to do*    
*I understand your anger towards me			 She left me for another guy*    
*But we're meant to be, we're meant to be		My oh my, why did I have to*  
*I did you wrong, I crossed a line			        Cheat on her, cheat on her*    
*I admit that the blame's all mine			        I don't have a clue*    
*I'll touch the sky and leave the earth			Why I did it, I don't know*    
*To give you all that you deserve			        I'm stuck inside the truth*

Rhymewords that just rhyme, but don't add value to the story, are left out and words that strengthen the story are here to stay

*Extra tip: you can write a storyline for each verse, so a story develops throughout the entire song.*   
*For instance:*    
Verse 1: 	describe what he and she had together    
Verse 2: 	the confession    
Chorus: 	write how you're going to get her back    
Verse 3: 	you see her with another guy    
Verse 4: 	what does this do to you?    
Chorus: 	repeat how you're going to get her back (it's a chorus, it repeats)    
Bridge: 	go on your knees, tell her all the things you're going to do for her      
Verse 5: 	she's convinced, she forgives you      
Chorus: 	write how you're going to get her back (and once you have, some ad libs might help to add extra words to describe to her you'll never ever ever do it again) 

I hope this was helpful to producers/songwriters/rappers here. I am curious to hear your thoughts on dealing with a writer's block and my article. I felt the need to share this, as it is really helpful to me to have these kind of tips and tricks. Wanting to write, but not being able to, is the most frustrating thing in the world for a musician.

Modern Music For Someone Who Doesn‚Äôt Like 2010s music,"My younger brother and I repeatedly get into debates about the quality of modern music. His taste in music is strictly The Beatles, The Beach Boys, Simon and Garfunkel, and the odd Weezer song. I am not really in a position to recommend him a good new modern album because I myself spend the most of my listening time in the 60s and 70s too, but I have huge respect for the 2010s and listen still quite a lot. 

So I ask the unmatched knowledge of the r/music nerds‚Äî what album should I get my brother to listen to to change his mind, and hopefully ease him into modern rock and pop?",Music,1571658280,dequelan,6,0,True,2019-10-21

When I met Bradley from Sublime.,"I [had](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q8nzUU-qdU&amp;list=FL76azjxsRS2qr46exB0dJeQ&amp;index=1) the great fortune to run into bradley in a little bar/lounge at the foot of the slopes in Aspen, CO. Think it was Jan or Feb of 1995, maybe Dec '94 - a bit hazy... Sublime played a show the night before with No Doubt (oh..No Doubt opened for them...). Brad was supposed to be snowboarding, but seemed to be comfortably imbibing too much to worry about riding. I was only 19, so he let me partake of his rum and cokes along with another ""kid"" who recognized him and pulled up a chair. We were chatting about all sorts of things, but mostly music. I mentioned I had run into Gwen a few minutes earlier and she said she couldn't afford to snow board. Bradley chuckled and said although he loved No Doubt, they had it all wrong. Touring with an entourage and all is quite expensive. That's when things turned to drugs. He said all he and the band needed to play a show was a couple hundred bucks for drugs, food, and gas to get to the next gig. No Doubt on the other hand needed to support a full support crew. Around this time he was rocking back and forth in his chair, ocassionally belting out part of a tune or humming under his breath. I noticed he was grabbing his hand and digging it a bit and then looking at it. After a bit, I asked him what was up. He grinned and said, rather excitedly, ""A new vein!"" I knew then that one day he most certainly would lose that war. My only regret is that I didn't share with him my uncle's plight - death by heroin OD only a few years earlier. But my guess is he had heard it all from many people who knew and loved him personally. Who was I?

Is there a way to listen to music all day without damaging your hearing?,"Hey all,

I work at a computer all day, so I tend to listen to music all day. Currently what I use noise canceling headphones, I set the music volume to 2 (Windows 10), and I'll sometimes lower the volume on Spotify (I always have it set to 'Normal' sound volume in the settings).

"{playlist} A Spotify list I worked on for more than 5 years featuring Epic, Orchestral, Cinematic music from movies, games, and amazing composers."," 

5 years ago I was on YouTube when I stumbled across what everyone was calling ""epic music"". I was taken aback by it and began listening non stop. That lead to me to ""epic music compilations"". These super long videos where people curated hours of epic music. Although I enjoyed some of them, I found a problem.

Many of these epic music compilations were far too overbearing. As in, they'd be great to listen to if you were lifting weights at the gym - but not so much if you're studying or working.

I set out to try to fix that by creating a different epic music compilation. What I tried to do was include a proper balance between the in-your-face songs and those that are quieter. So you could listen for hours without it feeling too heavy.

The result is this new Spotify epic music playlist. It's a collection of 12 hours of carefully crafted ""epic music"", from Skyrim, to Game of Thrones to Lord of The Rings (and many more). Spotify links are below if you'd like to give it a listen!

Don't these two songs sound similar? Kinks and NTVV,"[Neki To Vole Vruce - Teska Vremena Prijatelju Moj](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITZzn_Vjd34) \- This is a pretty popular rock song in Serbia, and I was listening to Kinks when the instruments sounded eerily familiar. Took me like 40 minutes to figure out which song it sounded like, and I finally found this one.

Hello I‚Äôm Shroom,"My actual name is Tommy and I figured this would be a good place to tell my story and promote myself. So Where do I even start? Well I was always a problem child, and by problem child I mean house arrest in 7th grade, states custody by 8th and spent a year and a half moving through placements until I was deemed able to go home at 15. I was put on Klonopin at 11 years old and by the time I was released at 15 I was on many different psych meds from Lithium to Seroquyl to Respirdol to Trazadone. The whole reason I‚Äôm explaining this is because this isn‚Äôt who I am, and I look back on it and wonder how much control I really had over my own thoughts and actions, but that being said Im 15 going through life, adjust to high school and not being institutionalized. Try to make music with my friends and honestly it wasn‚Äôt bad rhyme wise but there was something missing and I didn‚Äôt feel confident in the final product as a whole. After that project I had a 5 year crippling writers block that haunted me. There was So much stuff I was trying to catch up too in actual living that I felt almost completely disconnected to my musical side, BUT HERES WHERE IT GOES UP MY FRIEND. 
I sat with a good friend of mine and we tripped sipping a quarter worth of shroom tea one night. With that magical fungus I felt the hurt kid inside me who got ran through the system, fed pills like a PEZ dispenser and Suffered life changing trauma die and die happily. I started looking forward again, and I‚Äôm telling you right now. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to do with my music
And with that I present to you 2 songs of the mixtape I‚Äôll be putting up on a mixtape I call ‚ÄúA Beautiful Death‚Äù

High on nostalgia,"Has it ever happened to you that you listen, see, smell or touch something that will bring you memories back in your mind? To me it happens when I listen to music.  As life keep taking it course I link events mostly to music. Now as I'm a father of 4 I like to listen to the radio and let my kids tell me what songs makes them happy. Proudly I can say that they like mostly alternative rock. I do this because I have memories as I was growing up of my parents listening to certain songs and remebering the things we used to do as a family. Hopefully my kids will grow up and every time they listen to certain songs, they will remember me and their mom. Now do link every memorable event to music, even the bad ones, 1st heart brake, 1st brake up and so on. Some times I listen to a song and it does take me back in time and I start to remember things about it and then I just remember other things conected to it and I get on this nostalgic high that many times it makes me happy. I just wonder if it happens to any one else? In my experience I love it. Even it brings back bad memories, I start to see how much I have grown as a person.",Music,1569033787,chrisromero7777,1,2,True,2019-09-20

I've finally come around to giving Beyonce a listen.

I watched the music video for Single Ladies just to see what was so great about it that it's so iconic today, and that Kanye West made such a big deal about it in 2009. The never-ending worship she gets turned me off further. I have nothing against the woman herself, but _I cannot stress how strongly I believe **the Beyhive is one of THE SINGLE MOST RABID FANBASES any celebrity has ever had.**_

That being said, hearing her name come up sixteen trillion times in music related things, and the fact that artists I listen to like her, I'm finally ready to listen to Beyonce for myself. I don't mean to sound so harsh. Like I said, I don't hate *her* at all. It's the wild celebrity worship I'm not a big fan of.

International Girl Group,"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be in a girl group? Performing across the world like Destiny‚Äôs Child, Fifth Harmony, BlackPink, Red Velvet, 2NE1 or any of your favorite KPOP girl groups? Well then, read on.

Well I‚Äôve gave this a bit of thought I decided that I wanted to try and form a international girl group. The requirements will be listed below. 

Basically, my thoughts were, ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs short, so why not give it a try and see how it goes.‚Äù

REQUIREMENTS 

- You have to be 14+ 
- You have be able to dance to some extent.
- You must be able to rap or sing. 
- Must always be able to keep in contact. I‚Äôll be creating a group chat on either Snapchat, Instagram or Twitter. 
- The group will have seven members maximum. 

Exceptions can be made if necessary. 

- No discrimination. All races welcome! 
- You can be anywhere in the world. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Thus it being an international group. 

- These are just the main points, I will be adding more in the future. 

I will want to meet in the future with our members. We will all take this slow, which is the reason why I want 14+ and not 17, 18+ etc. 

EXCEPTIONS 

Being in a group, we‚Äôll all be improving and growing together. If you can‚Äôt dance as well as someone else can or sing as good as another can, don‚Äôt get discouraged! 

Trust me. I‚Äôm not Beyonc√© or Rihanna, okay? I can‚Äôt hit a glass shattering high note like Mariah Carey. But I have potential, you have potential, we all have potential! 

HOW TO JOIN?

- Like this post and text me, if you‚Äôre interested.
- I will text you and ask you for five things. 
               - Your name.
               - Your age. 
               - Your skills.
               - ONE picture of yourself.
               - What country you live in. 

You don‚Äôt have to say the state or city etc. Just answer with, ‚ÄòAmerica‚Äô, ‚ÄòCanada‚Äô, ‚ÄòEngland‚Äô etc.

AUDITIONS 

If a lot of people decide to want to join, I will be holding an audition. Basically, when I ask you for ‚ÄòYour Skills‚Äô in the verification part, depending on what you send me, for example if you say, ‚ÄòI can sing.‚Äô 

I will ask you for a video of you singing. You don‚Äôt have to be in the video. It can just be your voice. Just so I can see where you‚Äôre at and where other people are at as well.

POSITION AND ROLLS

So our group will consist of singers, dancers and rappers. 

Once all our members are formed, it will be up to us to decided who be the leader of this group. 

Believe me, I don‚Äôt have the strictness to be group leader. But I‚Äôll be more of a substitute manager/organizer for our group and plan practice dates etc. 

‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è 

If you are skeptical about joining, take your time and think about it. This is something that I want all of us to take serious. If you feel as if you can‚Äôt handle that sort of commitment, then feel free to take a day or two and think about what you‚Äôre signing up for. 

BUSINESS AND SCHEDULE 

We‚Äôll decide our schedule when the group is formed, then base our schedule to fit with everyone‚Äôs day to day plans. 

I suggest you download ‚ÄòHouseParty‚Äô or any other multi video chat app, where we can all video chat each other together. Again, all this information will be added in the future, depending on how much people decide to actually join and how fast they decide. 

Studio bookings and booking to perform will all be discussed in the later future. 

Management and hiring a manager for our group will be discussed by the whole group before being decided. It‚Äôs also something we won‚Äôt need to worry about until the future. 

PAYMENT AND MONEY 

This is completely free. No charges, though things like dance or singing lessons for yourself, you‚Äôll have to look into with your guardian. 

I suggest signing up for dance at your local school, or doing vocal arts in school as well. (I‚Äôm not sure if you have it, but we have it in Canada. Basically In-School singing lessons.)

‚ùóÔ∏èFINALLY‚ùóÔ∏è

If you‚Äôve made it to the bottom of this post, it probably means that your interested or deciding to join. Again! Take your time, don‚Äôt rush it. Any further questions can be asked in the comments below or you can message me. 

Thank you for stopping to read this. You can carry on with your scrolling. Have a nice day!

"Wowaka's passing, and his impact on the Vocaloid community","If you follow Vocaloid music at all then you have probably heard of Wowaka, the creator of many songs to include ""Rolling Girl"", ""World's End Dancehall"", ""Two Faced Lovers"" and more. Unfortunately, he passed away in April and I am just now finding out... I'm quite sad, this man had the same relative impact the Led Zeppelin had on Rock and Metal; he changed EVERYTHING in a matter of minutes. Vocaloid artists today still use his techniques and his inspiration to write their songs, and he did things no one thought was possible with this new program at the time and I think without him, Vocaloid wouldn't be as popular or even exist nearly a decade after ""Rolling Girl"" was released. 

I know Vocaloids aren't particularily popular in the US, but to me, his music is incredible and deserves praise. His music is very important to me and when I was growing up so it hurts to lose an artist I listened to as a young teenager and even now. 

What do you think about Vocaloids and possibly even Wowaka's music if you've heard it? He also left behind a band named ""Hitorie"", but he is most known for his work with Hatsune Miku.

My main peeve is Jacob Collier. As undeniably talented he is, I can't enjoy any of his music. And I have really tried. Maybe this stems from some subconscious jealousy I have as the dude can seriously rip those keys, but I find a lot of his music (OC and covers) to be quite musically arrogant/obnoxious. Again, this isn't to downplay his talent, he's definitely going further than I probably ever will but for whatever reason, I cannot abide.",Music,1569065726,WillisWallace,26,3,True,2019-09-21

"[QUESTION] Old music video from the 90's, most probably seen on MTV","**\[QUESTION\] Old music video from the 90's, most probably seen on MTV** 

This is haunting me every 1-2 months for the last years, and have yet to find a proper answer - hopefully someone here works, I defer to the power of crowdsourcing on this one :-). 

Here goes: I remember seeing a video while in my high school years (1995-1999), most probably on MTV. The video is shot from the air while the camera is gliding over the surface of a calm water area (lake/fjord?) surrounded by rounded hills that are not too abrupt. The gliding doesnt seem to end, suggesting that the area is quite large. The music in the video plays for the entire duration of the flight over the water surface, and, to the best of my recollection, it is big beats (something similar to Chemical Brothers, might be a UK electronic music band from that period). 

Since there was not Youtube back then, it is kind of hard to locate the specific song using current search criteria, particularly since I remember neither the name of the song nor the name of the band.

But, today I went to search for it in hope of listening to that, and I could not find that version anymore. I am nto sure if the video was deleted or if the channel does not exist anymore, or the video might not be available for my region anymore.

Avant Garde Hip Hop,"Hey everyone

Growing up in Mexico and being more of a rock and electronic music kid, the Latin hip hop scene was really dreadful for me and in my eyes very stagnant, especially reggaet√≥n. Hip hop in general. But recently I was blown away by Residente‚Äôs debut album. I only knew him as the lead rapper from Calle 13, but listening to their song Latinoam√©rica made me open my mind and give hip hop another chance.

Residente‚Äôs debut album is hip hop, but he combines elements from other music styles, like Chinese opera, African chants, and Siberian throat singing. Very experimental and evolving.

I‚Äôve tried other times listening to hip hop like Death Grips but I just can‚Äôt get into them. I tried. I‚Äôm also a Die Antwoord fan since $O$ (do they count as hip hop?). And I recently discovered KOKOKO! (Do they also count as hip hop?) MF Doom is another one I‚Äôve tried getting into but it doesn‚Äôt pull me into it, except for that one song Red and Gold.

Residente‚Äôs debut album is the only hip hop album that has really blown my mind and made me want to open myself up to the hip hop genre. Who is your favorite avant garde hip hop artist and why?",Music,1563857457,perro0000,2,0,True,2019-07-23

Hey everyone I wrote these lyrics and I was wondering what your opinion on them was,"Floating 

Verse 1
Thoughts racing in my head
they‚Äôre so fast I can‚Äôt keep up anymore 
I‚Äôve hurt so many people 
My ex, my family, and my friends 
they abandoned me on the bench and walked away 
I took a walk in the woods
to look for a sprinkle of  hope 
but I got lost 
like a traveler looking for antiques 
thinking everything in front of them is unique 
but really it‚Äôs just cheap plastic like the people I met
and I‚Äôve been looking at the sky for an answer
but they all just float away like clouds in the sky

chorus 
I‚Äôm floating on water
blocking all the thoughts in my head
I‚Äôm floating in air
to get view of what‚Äôs up their
I‚Äôm laying in my bed
I can‚Äôt rest no more

verse 2
I see a glimmer of light 
in the night 
so I walk to try find it
but then it disappears 
like someone is playing with me
but I shouldn‚Äôt be mad
I‚Äôve done that before 
there was someone that needed me
but I was scared of the dark 
and the felling of loneliness 
and if went I would be judged 
but that‚Äôs just how life is 
you have to take chances 
and if you don‚Äôt you will miss out
and end up floating away

There will be two more pieces on 70's reggae, and one final epic piece on Marley (published each Sunday on that website).

**Some context**: I've always listened to all kinds of music: metal, jazz, soul, country (yup) etc, while my brother have been obsessively listening to jamaican music only for 20 years.

He's a walking encyclopedia and his CD collection is absolutely MASSIVE. 

Anyways, this makes for some great reading.

He was a bit hesitating and searching for his style at the start, naturally, so the pieces get better and better. These pieces are published each sunday, and these four first ones are great but the next three (2 on 70's reggae and a final one on Marley) are **stunning**, I know I'm biased but really this is some dope shit.

I've tried the Deepl stuff and of course you lose a lot but it's quite good compared to google translate.

You can ask any question in English on the last piece ([early reggae](https://www.contrepoints.org/2019/07/21/349500-reggae-introduction-au-early-reggae-4), the comments are still open today) or on the next 3 pieces (comments are open 2 days I think), I'll translate them in the comments he answers to everything.

Is Rock-Punk-Metal dead in 2019? Music requests...,"Hello community,

So long story short: I've decided to keep a bit updated about music of this and last year, but I'm having trouble to keep up with all the auto-tune, same beats, kind of latino-ish music everywhere.  
So I am kind of giving up, since my favourite music is rock, metal and so on from the 90s and 00s.  


Could you please share your favourite tunes of recent metal and rock songs that are similar to bands like:

* Linkin Park (Hybrid Theory, Meteora)
* Paramore (All we Know is Falling, Riot!)
* Fireflight (Unbreakable)
* Slipknot (sub. Verses)  
etc,  
I really like that kind of power-rock or power-metal vibes (basicly power chords moving around all the fretboard) with some awesome break downs.  


Keep on rocking!",Music,1563863546,aquakeyblademaster,11,0,True,2019-07-23

we were absolutely terrible but it just made us laugh so like,,, cool even better ya kno. did that for about a year til we   
realized how much better we were then before. After that realization i stopped rapping as a joke and i started taking    
it serious, still just freestyling but i saw my progress and all i wanted to do was make them juicy flames.  Couple years   
later(right now) i'm sitting in my house making music day and night... its not that great buuutttt... im learning... soon   
as i do though i got this shit i know it. I put music on my soundcloud everyday nonstop.. i try to do it all so i've been   
"" Doing  alot of weird stuff with hopes that it eventually grows natural to me. "" - lilsashii

stop progressing. so yeah thats my plan and goals... to  learn and learn until i perfect it and once i do theres nothing   
stopping me from just straight up blessing the world.   i could write a lot more but like i just thought who wants to read   
   all that.. so i feel like i wrapped it all up and got my point across, thanks alot for listening really thanks so much like any   
""support means the world."" - ME too ""but probably alot of other people too""         

(if you dont like a song just skip it and check out others.    IF       YOU      DONT       LIKE       EM

App or service to classify / rate / music and log what‚Äôs played? (last.fm for Spotify?),"This is a bit of an odd request, and may be challenging to explain.

1.	To be able to ‚Äòtag‚Äô artists / albums / songs in some way so I can search for these custom tags + genres
2.	To be able to see what I have listened to (I use Spotify currently)
3.	To be able to add notes or ‚Äòrate‚Äô tracks in some way

The reason for this - I listen to a lot of music, I forget what I have listened to, I‚Äôm a bit obsessive when it comes to tracking things and I find playlists to be inadequate.

I used to use the last.fm scrobbler in the iPod days and that was great for the time.

Concert ticket reselling: a hypothetical,"TLDR: don't downvote, someone needs two tickets but buys four to subsidized the cost of their tickets by selling the other two. What are your opinions?

I haven't dont this, I dont plan on doing this, and I don't condone doing this. So please don't downvote me, I'm just curious what the general opinion on this is.

So we all know that sites like ticket master are bad. They overcharge and are mostly filled with people who are either bots just buying up tickets or people who aren't fans of the bands and are just looking to make money. 

So the question is, if someone is going to a concert of a band they really love. They and a single friend are going together (only 2 tickets) but they buy four tickets planning on selling the other two. This allows them to get the tickets they wanted but at a cheaper price to see a band they love. 

What are your thought on this practice?",Music,1563871485,Yakobee,1,0,True,2019-07-23

A Simple Step by Step Guide to Create Your Music Brand,"Hey guys I was asked recently about music branding from an artist we helping to promote. So I thought I would put together a really simple guide on how to create a music brand. These are just my thoughts and from my experience. As always a little disclaimer that I dont claim to be the saviour of music marketing but just want to share my little bit of knowledge that might help someone who doesn't know where to start. If you wish to correct me on anything feel free to I welcome constructive opinions with a smile :) 

&amp;#x200B;

Think of Kiss, The Rolling Stones, Wu-Tang Clan or Fatboy Slim ‚Äì they all have a huge music brand. You can instantly identify their music via their brand, their logos, their pictures, their style ‚Äì and of course via their unique music.

&amp;#x200B;

**And that is the power of good music branding: it makes you stand out, it makes you recognisable and it spreads your musical message faster than you can say Billboard Top 100.**

&amp;#x200B;

Building a music brand is key to making it in the music industry. But what is a brand? It‚Äôs a name, design or logo that sums up your music/personality. Your brand should encapsulate your music ‚Äì so that if fans see your logo, hear your music, wear one of your T-shirts, they instantly know it‚Äôs your brand. Your brand starts with you ‚Äì your style, your music, your look and feel. And creating it is easier than you think, with our easy-to-follow guide‚Ä¶

&amp;#x200B;

* Capture the perfect press shots
* Write your own bio and press
* Find the right logo

## Say Cheese.¬†How To Get The Perfect Press Shot

Your photo is, for many, their first impression of you online. So it needs to be carefully thought out and represent your brand, your personality and your music.

#### #1 If in doubt, keep the photos and the shoot simple.

You‚Äôll want to present a range of photos including black and white and colour, some action shots and some more staged arty and colourful shots. Giving a full range means that your photos are more likely to fit the remit of magazines and blogs. Especially if they‚Äôre looking for cooler, edgier shots or more professional portraits.

#### 2#¬†Make sure the theme fits your music.

There‚Äôs no point doing a high energy shot with a graffiti background if you‚Äôre an acoustic folk quartet. There‚Äôs definitely something to be said for contrast, but make sure the photos represent the band‚Äôs ethos and personality. If you‚Äôre a fun band, try not to look like you‚Äôre here under duress.

#### 3#¬†Look to others for inspiration.

Check out band photos from your favourite acts and DJs and ask the photographer to use that as a basis. It‚Äôs an easy win for everyone and gives you a template to work towards.

#### 4#¬†Use cool locations and quirky shoots to make you stand out.

Be different, be unique and create a signature look for the band. If you have a band style or uniform, use it and turn your photos into another element of branding. Props are generally a no-go, however, especially for staged photos and portraits. Nothing screams ‚Äòcheese‚Äô louder than an unplugged set of decks or set of drum sticks in the picture.

#### 5#¬†Oh, and use a professional photographer.

This could be a friend, this could be someone you‚Äôve found online but make sure it‚Äôs someone who knows their way around a zoom-finder and knows their aperture from their ahem‚Ä¶

#### 6#¬†Make sure the photos are clearly labeled.

The photographer is credited. Try to keep the file size as small as possible if you‚Äôre emailing the images direct (use a file converter or zip file if you have to email them direct). Better still, upload them all to a private Dropbox link and send that over. Files should be 300 PPI resolution and be good enough to use in print media ‚Äì generally, anything from 200kb to 5MB is good.

#### 7#¬†Don‚Äôt use photos from Facebook or Instagram. 

They‚Äôre low-res, low quality and will look cheap and nasty. If you want to get a stylised image, ask your photographer to tweak and work on the images in Photoshop.

## The Write Stuff

**Biographies** ‚Äì or bios for short ‚Äì are used to tell your story and give you an introduction: your influences, first gigs, career highlights, music releases and a few quotes. In short, **they sum up your brand**, ethos and attitude in about 300 words, so they‚Äôre pretty crucial.

The way bios work has changed. Where before a bio could go on for 600 plus words, now you‚Äôd want **to condense yours to 200-300** ‚Äì they‚Äôre much shorter, sharper and snappier. If you really want to showcase your story, then have two ‚Äì a longer, in-depth bio and a shorter, more factual version.

You can also go out on a limb with bios ‚Äì there are funny ones, really good long ones¬†and just terrible, terrible ones that go viral for all the wrong reasons. We‚Äôve put together a simple list of tips and ideas to get your bio off the ground ‚Äì but if in doubt, think of **KISS: Keep It Simple Stupid**.

## How To Do It

#### 8#¬†Write down all your DJ achievements in ranking order.

If you‚Äôve played at Creamfields or Glastonbury, that goes at the top. If your band played at your Dad‚Äôs 50th, that doesn‚Äôt go anywhere near the list. Then write down a list of any releases/remixes you‚Äôve had, again in descending order.

#### 9#¬†What makes you unique, what makes you stand out from other DJs?

Do you have a broader range of music, are you a skilled decknician, can you cut and scratch, or do you play something no one else does?

Do you make your own music, do you or your act have a niche sound, do you write for music magazines? You can even step outside of the music realm if it‚Äôs interesting enough ‚Äì if you were part of the NASA program, a professional footballer as a kid or a trained airline pilot, **feel free to name-drop**.

You want the bio to be interesting and stick in the memory. Write down everything and try to find the balance between being humble and showing off ‚Äì it‚Äôs a bit of a tightrope, but read it out loud to yourself and then a friend and you‚Äôll soon find out how it really sounds.

#### 10#¬†Get some testimonials.

Press cuttings and quotes are best, but if not, ask previous club owners, promoters, fellow DJs (the bigger/more current the names the better) for quotes about you and your performance.

&amp;#x200B;

If you turned up, vomited on their decks and punched the promoter‚Äôs girlfriend, then you might not want to go there‚Ä¶ **Pick out your biggest gigs** ‚Äì there‚Äôs no reason to list everything, but cherry-pick the best gigs, the biggest festivals, the big names you‚Äôve played with. And be honest ‚Äì **if you were first on the bill 10 hours before Jamie Jones or Arcade Fire came on, then don‚Äôt say you‚Äôve warmed up for them.**

#### 11#¬†List all your internet homes

These include the likes of Facebook, Soundcloud, Mixcloud, personal email and phone number.

#### 12#¬†Compile Step 1-4 in order.¬†

In 4 separate paragraphs or if you‚Äôre feeling confident try to weave it into a story.

&amp;#x200B;

**Congratulations, you now have a bio.**

## Get The Right Logo For You 

Think of your favourite brands and you can nearly always visualise their logo. The two go hand in hand, which means your logo needs to represent your music, your identity, your personality. That can be a mega-expensive process, but thankfully, there are plenty of online logo generators and even some free ones!

#### 13#¬†Your logo should relate to your music.

It should be unique and it should be instantly recognisable. It could use your name in a stylish font or it could use your influences to create a look and feel. Alternatively, you could play with a variety of fonts, colours and designs to create a bespoke piece of art.

#### 14#¬†Start by compiling other logos you like.¬†

Google images is a great place to start.¬†Save the images as you go along or add them to your [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.co.uk/maanamusic/) account. Then decide what‚Äôs going to be in your logo ‚Äì your initials, your full name, your catchphrase?

#### 14# Doing it the cheaper way

If you‚Äôre looking to do things cheaply, there are plenty of online logo generators out there. They‚Äôll run through a series of questions and generate a logo for you. You might strike gold first time around, or it might take you a few goes to get something that‚Äôs workable. Check out [Tailorbrands.](https://www.tailorbrands.com/logo-ideas/band-logos)

#### 16# Get it done¬†professionally.

If you‚Äôre serious about your career, however, it‚Äôs much better to go to a professional designer that you pay for. There are plenty of sites that will develop a logo for you. Sites like Looka, Canva Logo and Squarespace Logowill work through the process for you, letting you alter and adapt as you go.

#### 17# Ask Your Friends

Another good way is to get a logo is ask on social networks if you‚Äôre connected with any designers or ask for recommendations. Your designer might charge by the hour or for a completed project. And they‚Äôll be able to take your ideas and influences on board, creating a professional logo that could last as long as your career. They‚Äôll also deliver your logo in a range of formats including JPG, PDF, Vectors etc, designed for a range of uses.

## Create The Right Design For Your Music Brand

An extension of your logo, you should ideally create a design ethic for your brand. Your logo will lead the way, creating a rough template, but you‚Äôll need to consider a range of different factors. Your logo designer or website might be able to help with the process, otherwise you‚Äôll need to tackle the points below on your own.

#### 18# What font style?

Deciding which font you want to use might be the last thing you‚Äôd want to tackle, but it matters a lot to many people. There are around 300,000 fonts in the world, so finding the right one can be a challenge. Do you want it to be fun and playful? Serious and official? Unique or easy to read?

#### 19# Finding a font¬†

Head to a site like [Dafont](https://www.dafont.com/) for inspiration. It has thousands to choose from and handily breaks them down into a variety of categories, styles and designs. You can then download your font or even use that font for your logo.

#### 20# It‚Äôs all in the colour

As well as getting the right font, your design look and feel also needs to include what colours you use. As well as your own favourite colours, you‚Äôll need to consider what colours work well for marketing and branding. This piece has some great insight into the psychology of colours. As a quick takeaway, up to 90% of people will judge your marketing and make a snap judgement based on the colour, so it‚Äôs worth getting right from the start!

#### 21# The home of your brand

The colours and font you use are particularly important when you decide to launch your own website. Using sites like Facebook, Instagram, Soundcloud etc will work in the early stages of your career, but having your own website is invaluable once you can afford the running costs.

You can then control your own content and you‚Äôre not beholden to other sites that might close or change their content rules overnight. And you can use it to push and promote all your content in one space, build up a database, create sales and more.

## Create an Electronic Press Kit (EPK)

An Electronic Press Kit (EPK) brings together everything above ‚Äì your logo, your bio, your press images and your brand‚Äôs design. ¬†It‚Äôs everything a promoter or record label needs to know about your music in an easy-to-read format that puts everything in front of them. Your EPK should include‚Ä¶

#### 22# High res press images¬†

Saved on a Dropbox link plus a selection of hi res images spread through the document

#### 23# Social media links 

that you use ‚Äì Facebook and Instagram are generally the most popular but make sure you start utilising video ie Youtube as this is a [music marketing trend in 2019.](https://www.impactbnd.com/blog/video-marketing-in-2019-infographic)

#### 24#¬†Links to your online music 

be that Soundcloud, Mixcloud, Bandcamp, iTunes, Spotify, Beatport etc

#### 25# A¬†biography

A well-written short, sharp and sweet **biography**¬†that covers all the bases and lets people know just how awesome you are.

#### 26# Testimonials and quotes

If you‚Äôve warmed up for Paul McCartney and he loved you, ask for a quote and stick it in. The bigger the better. If you‚Äôve done your mate‚Äôs wedding, then maybe not‚Ä¶

#### 27# Select discography

Don‚Äôt reel off pages and pages of your releases, but pick some key singles, EPs and albums that reflect your journey and make you stand out

#### 28# Videos

It‚Äôs the 21st century, and people expect that you have good video content. Add links with a good thumbnail image to the EPK demonstrating how kick-ass you are

#### 29# Press¬†Clippings

Compile your best press cuttings, interviews, reviews and online coverage

#### 30# Contact details

An obvious one, but you‚Äôd be surprised how often it‚Äôs missing. Add in your country and your email and phone number if you‚Äôre happy being contacted there

#### 31# Create your EPK

An easy way to make an EPK yourself is to use **Google docs**‚Äì they have a range of templates you can easily use and edit, allowing you to add photos, weblinks and more.

The easiest way to make your EPK stand out is for it to truly be electronic ‚Äì embed videos and music links into the page and use hyperlinks¬†that will take the reader directly to your music, website or social media page so they can check our your new track or gauge your audience.

&amp;#x200B;

Once it‚Äôs ready, you can then send the link directly as your EPK or you can then save the page as a PDF or Word Document and use that.

&amp;#x200B;

Hope this helped someone.

While some still hold that the Velvet Underground was the premiere proto-punk band in the mid-to-late 1960's, many music historians now agree that the Scottish band The Bay City Rollers (1964-1987 version) had more of an influence on the very early formative years of punk rock in the USA (approx. 1968-1972).

Give any one of their many hits a listen and you will hear what Johnny Ramone heard...a driving, accelerated beat with little pretense and a stripped-down sound.

The hate towards Imagine Dragons,"I'm gonna start this off by saying Imagine Dragons is my favorite band, so go ahead and call me ""biased"" and downvote me if you don't want to read the rest of this post.

Have you ever heard of the term ""bullying""? It's a pretty common one, meaning to harass or put down a person or group. I.E. what everyone seems to be doing towards Imagine Dragons, whether it be hateful comments or posts on social media. The question is, why? What do you gain out of putting someone else down, people who work hard to make something that someone else may love?

I'm not a big fan of Twenty One Pilots, or Taylor Swift, or Kendrick Lamar, but I don't go relentlessly attacking them for no reason. Each one of them is someone's favorite artist, and they bring their fans happiness. You may not like Imagine Dragons' music, but is that any reason to trash them on social media, calling them ""the worst band on Earth""?

I get that a lot of their mainstream stuff sounds the same, and may be good for advertisers, but that can be said about most mainstream music in the modern day. Songs like ""Thunder"", ""Radioactive"", and ""Believer"" are great for advertising and might sound similar. However, a lot of their unknown songs, such as ""The Fall"", ""Amsterdam"", and ""Clouds"", all have deeper meanings instead of being your state of the art love songs that you hear 90% of the time every single day. I doubt you'd hear ""Second Chances"" playing on any commercial.

So please, stop the hate. They may not make you happy, but they make me happy. Can't we all just band together and appreciate music, even if we don't like it, instead of bashing it senselessly? A lot of time, effort, and heart goes into making any type of music, not just Imagine Dragons. You may not know what an artist might mean to someone.",Music,1561272921,LordAyeris,27,0,True,2019-06-23

Sudden rush of strange sound,"It was Friday evening, I decided to lay down and just relax without smartphone, laptop or any other device. I remember I was staring at white wall, I stared so much that I felt I went into some sort of trans. It was all normal and usual until something really strange happened. I was zoned out and I heard some sort of music, a beat - an instrumental. It was so clear and I never heard it before, I felt it in my ears and my brain. There was no music around me or outside of the house, this was a moment that lasted for approximately two or three seconds. 

&amp;#x200B;

I felt like I was creating my own beat during these few seconds, using emotions and feelings.

"Piano song recommendations (I like Antony and the Johnsons, Regina Spektor, Galina Ustvolskaya...)","I feel that despite listening to a fair bit of records and playing piano myself, I still haven't found my favourite piano music. I like dark songs with (at times) strange chord progressions, or dissonance... But not when it's taken too far. For example Antony and the Johnsons has a lot of appeal for me for its dark lyrics (songs like Hope There's Someone, The Lake, and The Spirit Was Gone From Her Body), also a song like Genius Next Door by Regina Spektor. But the piano parts on these songs seem sort of straightforward to me (as well as the style, I feel like Regina Spektor is a bit too clean and poppy for my liking). A song which I rate in terms of its piano playing but not that much in terms of lyrics or style is Girl Anachronism by The Dresden Dolls.  I also like Ustvolskaya, Shostakovich, Gubaidulina, all that Russian avant-garde stuff, but all that is a bit *too* dissonant for me (and there's no lyrical component!) so that also leaves something to be lacking.

I also really like a couple odd tracks by artists who aren't well-known for using piano in their music (see below -- Arca, Panda Bear, Broadcast)

It's probably obvious from what I've written that I haven't found anything that ticks all the right boxes for me in terms of what I like, but can anyone recommend anything on the basis of these artists/songs?

Help remembering band name!,"Hello, not sure if this is the right place for this, but there is the band I really liked that I guess is kinda synth-pop or whatever (not really good with genre definitions) and for the life of me I can't remember it. All I remember clearly is that in one of the songs it samples an episode of the twilight zone with I believe marilyn monroe 

""What you need is a cup of instant smile"" 

""i had a cup of instant-smile, i don't feel like smiling! sometimes i wanna cry or frown!"" thats part of the sample.

Is rap the new rock n roll?,"Rock music is dead in competing in popular music coming nowadays, rap seems to of taken place and is repeating it 

Rap in the 70‚Äôs+80‚Äôs-rock in the 50‚Äôs
Rap in the 90s- rock in the 60‚Äôs
Rap in the 00‚Äôs-rock in the 70‚Äôs
(Now) rap in the 10‚Äôs-rock in the 80‚Äôs
Rap in the 20‚Äôs-rock in the 90‚Äôs
Rap in the 30‚Äôs- rock in the 00‚Äôs
Rap in the 40‚Äôs- rock in the 10‚Äôs



Rap in the 70‚Äôs-80‚Äôs= rock in the 50‚Äôs

In each time period, they were born 
The first songs to be considered in that genre were produced think for example

Johnny b Goode- chuck berry (rock)
Rapper delight- the sugarhill gang (rap)

Both were success and paved the way for inspiration for new up-comers in the genre.

Rap in the 90‚Äôs=rock in the 60‚Äôs

Many fans in rock and rap see this time period as the best time period of music produced in the genre there into.
Rock.                  Rap
The Beatles- N.W.A
Jimi Hendrix -  Tupac
Rolling Stones-wu-tang clan 
The doors- tribe called quest 
So on so fort 

At these times both genres hit mainstream success and hitting records 
Many legends of each genre are still remembered as being the best, example the Beatles and Tupac 

The 2000‚Äôs of rap=70‚Äôs of rock
Rap.            Rock

Eminem=Queen
Kanye West=Led Zeppelin 
50 cent= Aerosmith 

Both Would still rise in popularity with no stop upcoming. Many greats would still go on to the next decade 

10‚Äôs of rap= 80‚Äôs of rock=the peak
Rock.                   Rap
Guns N‚Äô Roses= xxxtentacion 
Van Halen= lil uzi vert
Kiss=lil pump 

By now 2 popular sub genres of both of each genre had peaked 

Hair metal=rock  mumble rap=rap 

Both where really popular and had no stop until.....


(From now onwards it will be based on predictions and how rock prevailed)

In rock a new sub genre of rock came the Seattle grunge scene, this killed the hair metal scene making it look uncool. Bands such as Nirvana,soundgarden, Pearl Jam and Alice In Chains pushed this sub genre into mainstream. The song ‚Äòsmells like teen spirit‚Äò by Nirvana blew up overnight and grunge then went on to prevail over hair metal to its demise. 

Grunge would eventually kill it self thanks to event such as Kurt cobain suicide in 1994 and many grunge groups breaking up 

In 1995 the last really main steam hit 
Sub genre came in rock. Nu metal 

Bands such as linkin park, deftones, System of a Down, slipknot, limp biskit etc 

However they would become hated by fans of rock and metal 

Rap in the 30‚Äôs= rock in the 00‚Äôs

Nu metal,emo rock and alternate rock would be the last standing legs of rock music in this era but both 

And finally 

40‚Äôs of rap=10‚Äôs of rock 

By now rock was dead from the mainstream. The only thing close was indie rock such as twenty one pilots and Mumford and suns.
If rap continues to follow rock it will eventually die in the 2030‚Äôs-2040‚Äôs",Music,1561302889,rebiller099,4,0,True,2019-06-23

Res Announces Highly Anticipated New Solo Album,"Multi-genre artist Res (pronounced ""Reese"") has announced her long-awaited album The Woman With A Thousand Faces, set to release this summer. She'll kick things off with the edgy, haunting first single ""Hollow"", produced by Jordan Davis (available on all streaming platforms 5/17/19).

Her debut album, How I Do, released in 2001, sold over 300,000 copies and offered an edgy rock-soul alternative to the neo-soul wave that dominated the era.

Over a decade after her debut album How I Do, Res' music maintains all the beauty and earnestness that captured the adoration of fans around the world. But don't call it a comeback, Res never stopped making music.

""The songs on this album were written as I faced all the challenges that came with taking full control of my life. I sing them because I found that the path forward is through patience, strength, and faith in myself.

""My songwriting partner Jonathan Jennings took the journey with me as we worked our way through the songwriting process. We wrote about my life as it was unfolding in real time. We talked for hours on end about my fears, my past relationships, the people close to me, and, most important, the choices I had made. What we discovered was I had become comfortable with being uncomfortable. Once we uncovered that truth, our writing became honest and the hooks and lyrics just spilled out. I think these are some of the best songs of my career and I'm looking forward to sharing them with my fans."" - Res

In addition to her new album, fans will be thrilled to know that she is currently routing a tour of intimate shows across North America to showcase her hits, both known and undiscovered.

Res has worked with an impressive roster of award-winning artists including Mary J. Blige, Maxwell, Musiq Soulchild, Gnarls Barkley, John Mayer, and Alanis Morissette, among others.

While accepting her BET Award for album A Seat At The Table, Solange listed Res as one of her inspirations alongside Erykah Badu, Lauren Hill, Missy Elliott, and Aaliyah.

Good music from Smaller Artists to use on Twitch Streams?,"I stream pretty often on Twitch and for music I usually just play music from my main Spotify playlist, my VODs have certain parts completely muted because of copyright, I'm trying to find smaller artists so I can ask for permission to use their music. I enjoy music in any language honestly with a preference to Korean, Spanish, and English speaking artists. I listen to music from My absolute favorite Amy Winehouse, to EDM(Love Deep House) to K-pop(or artists like Hyukoh and Cloud) to Pop with an undying love for Lady Gaga. 

&amp;#x200B;

I really want to get bigger on Twitch so I want to make it a habit to not have anything that could hinder me or get me a strike while I'm still small.

Born To Be Wild ‚Äì The unlikely backstory behind an iconic hit record,"*Life is an evolutionary art. We are in a constant state of becoming and never know at the beginning how things may turn out.*

Such was the case for Canadian Dennis Eugene McCrohan. He and his brother Jerry, changed their names to ‚ÄúEdmonton‚Äù, in honor of one of their favorite cities. They felt the brand might generate some memory traction when they were recruited by Dave Marden to join his band, [*The Sparrows*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sparrows_(band)), in 1964.

Marden was a British emigree who changed his name to Jack London. *The Sparrows* endeavored to capitalize on the British Invasion, affecting English Accents and attempting to channel the vibe that was making the Beatles and the Stones famous.

The group also attracted the attention of Joachim Fritz Krauledat. Born during the Second World War in what would become East Germany, Krauledat learned English the same way he learned to love Rock &amp; Roll, listening to American Forces Radio. Plagued by vision problems as a youth, he developed an enhanced ability to hear the nuances of the music and taught himself how to play the guitar. By the late 1950s, he had relocated to Canada, changing his name to the more pronounceable ‚Äú[John Kay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kay_(musician))‚Äú, joining Dennis and Jerry in *The Sparrows*¬†in 1965.

The group took a circuitous route to Los Angeles, connecting with musician, songwriter and producer, [Gabriel Mekler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabriel_Mekler), who urged Kay to reconstitute the Sparrows as [*Steppenwolf*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppenwolf_(band))*,* a nod to Hermann Hesse‚Äôs novel of the same name. The group landed a deal with ABC Dunhill, home to [*The Mamas &amp; The Papas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mamas_and_the_Papas), and went into the studio to with Mekler try and concoct a hit.

By then, Dennis Edmonton was no longer with the band and had rebranded himself as the ethereal [Mars Bonfire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Bonfire). At the time, he was broke and failing as a would-be Hollywood songwriter. When he acquired a used Ford Falcon, the ability to explore the California‚Äôs mountains and dip his feet in the Pacific Ocean felt liberating. [He told Canadian journalist Juliette Jagger,](https://juliettejagger.com/origin-stories-mars-bonfire-on-steppenwolfs-born-to-be-wild/) ‚ÄúThe feeling that came with being out on the road in my car was total freedom.‚Äù

It inspired him to write a song.

‚Äú‚ÄòGet your motor running. Head out on the highway.‚Äô Those lyrics,‚Äù he told Jagger, ‚Äújust flowed right out of me.‚Äù

He presented Kay with what was, at the time, a ballad. Bonfire had pedaled it, unsuccessfully, to a half dozen other groups and three music publishers. Kay saw potential. Steppenwolf sped it up, morphing the tune into a power rock rendition, and *Born to Be Wild* was born.

There are numerous examples of acts that transformed original recordings to faster tempos and greater chart success. Consider Shorty Long‚Äôs [*Devil With the Blue Dress On*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jaZ3pxgvfhY). Few remember the original, but I bet you started humming [the Mitch Ryder version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KVbr37_yPeY) when you read the title. The Eddie Floyd rendition of¬† [*Knock On Wood*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kceiks__PsE) holds its own as one of the best to come out of the Stax hit machine. But it was Ami Stewart who [reimagined the tune](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txaPCj8MZuM) into an percussive disco classic.

Tom Hanks may have been thinking about B*orn to Be Wild* when he plotted ‚Äú[That Thing You Do](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPMLG8mnCRM)‚Äú. In the story, Jimmy wrote it as a love song. Drummer Guy Patterson‚Äôs split second decision to speed it up at a talent show that started The Wonders‚Äô rise to fleeting fame.

The first attempt to get *Born to Be Wild* down on tape didn‚Äôt have the magic the band was looking for. So they switched venues, re-recording the tracks at the [Don Polodor](http://www.gotofirstclass.com/about/index.staff_46d7c63a12c6a6e9466b804ee1ba5de1.html)‚Äòs American Recording Company, located on Hollywood‚Äôs legendary Sunset Boulevard.

Until then, engineers didn‚Äôt quite know how to handle amps turned up to full volume. Polodor‚Äôs partner, Bill Cooper, was just fine with it. [He remembers](https://forums.stevehoffman.tv/threads/american-recording-studios.146923/) that the facility, ‚Äúhad an echo chamber lined with big sheets of metal that Richie (Don‚Äôs brother) glued to the walls. It also, to our knowledge, was the first studio to have solid state preamps that were run on car batteries because they were such a pure source of DC current.‚Äù

[Mix Magazine‚Äôs Gary Eskow chronicles the recording of Born To Be Wild in his Classic Tracks column](https://www.mixonline.com/recording/classic-tracks-steppenwolfs-born-be-wild-365997).¬† Cooper placed highly directional Syncron microphones in front of Steppenwolf‚Äôs [Fender Dual Showmen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fender_Showman) amplifiers, mic‚Äôed Jerry Edmonton‚Äôs bass drum, put John Kay behind a [Sony C37](http://www.coutant.org/sonyc37a/) to maximize his raspy vocals (Neumann U47s were the accepted standard in the day) and let the Scully 8-track tape recorder roll.

At the time, no one in the band thought it was anything special.

[Kay told Mix](https://www.mixonline.com/recording/classic-tracks-steppenwolfs-born-be-wild-365997), ‚ÄúDuring the sessions, it got no more or less of a response than anything else we were working on. ‚ÄòSookie, Sookie‚Äô came out earlier and did fine, but it got no airplay in the South. It was vaguely suggestive, and our sound didn‚Äôt make it clear whether we were a black or white band. A song called ‚ÄòA Girl I Knew‚Äô was actually the first single off the album, but it got very little airplay. We knew we‚Äôd only have the opportunity to release one more single off the album before it got buried. The label was leaning toward ‚ÄòEverybody‚Äôs Next One,‚Äô a song that I‚Äôd co-written with our producer, Gabriel Meckler, but our manager, Red Foster, was also a disk jockey at KRLA in L.A., and he put feelers out to friends of his who were also jocks, and the consensus opinion was that ‚ÄòBorn to Be Wild‚Äô was the strongest contender.‚Äù

As usual, the people closest to the audience were right. *Born to Be Wild* exploded onto the charts in 1968. It was the first record to use the term ‚Äúheavy metal thunder‚Äù, which would define a musical genre.

When Dennis Hopper was looking for music to accentuate the soundtrack of his forthcoming indy film, ‚Äú[Easy Rider](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easy_Rider)‚Äú, *Born to Be Wild* ended up front and center along with contributions from [The Band](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Band),¬†[The Byrds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Byrds), and [The Jimi Hendrix Experience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jimi_Hendrix_Experience). ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMbATaj7Il8))

The record peaked at Number 2 on the Billboard charts, unable to unseat the tamer *People Got to Be Free* by the Rascals. With the passage of time, *Born To Be Wild* surpassed the Rascals‚Äô 60s freedom anthem, as new generations identified with its universal appeal.

In an era of digital downloads, it still sells. When I penned this piece, *Born To Be Wild* ranked at #319 on the current list of best selling songs at Amazon.com. *People Got to Be Free* stood at #71,981.

Steppenwolf took their act on the road, earning rave reviews for a performance at the Fillmore East with an eclectic bill that also included Buddy Rich and The Children of God. Later that same year, they opened for Iron Butterfly at the Baltimore Civic Center.

Meckler went on to helm successful albums for [Three Dog Night](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Dog_Night), and¬†[Janis Joplin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janis_Joplin). He also partnered with¬† [Etta James](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etta_James) for two critically acclaimed LPs in the early 70s. He died in a motorcycle accident in 1977.

Mars Bonfire moved with his wife to Western Nevada and became renown in California‚Äôs ‚ÄúHundred Peaks Section‚Äù as a hiker. The LA Times reported that, by 2008, the ‚Äúaffable‚Äù hiking leader had conquered the Sierra Club‚Äôs 276 top California summits 8 times.

American Recording Company, the birthplace of dozens of hit records for everyone from The Beach Boys and the Blues Image and Alice Cooper and the Souther, Hillman Furay Band, ultimately had to relocate. According to Bill Cooper, ‚ÄúEventually, Lawrence Welk (who owned the building) said we were making too much noise and we had to move.‚Äù

Welk was never able to lease the facility again.

As always happens in every chapter of the history of Rock &amp; Roll, the original Steppenwolf ultimately broke up. There were several unauthorized incarnations between 1976 and 1980. Kay again became involved with the project that year and¬† continued to tour with a revolving cast of musicians backing him. He delighted audiences with *Born to Be Wild*¬†and [the rest of the Steppenwolf cannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steppenwolf_(band)#Discography) until a [final concert appearance on October 14, 2018](https://steppenwolf.com/n-11238-its-been-a-hell-of-a-ride.html).

Kay, writing for the band‚Äôs official blog after that performance, thanked his loyal fan base for ‚Äúone hell of a ride.‚Äù He now concentrates on his non-profit, [The Maue Kay Foundation](https://mauekay.org/), which ‚Äúsupports individuals and organizations engaged in the protection of wildlife, the environment and human rights.‚Äù

In April of that same year, *Born to Be Wild* was among [the first group of singles to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame](https://bestclassicbands.com/rock-hall-singles-category-4-15-18/). Steppenwolf, long considered worthy of induction is still awaiting that honor.

*We all have the capacity to create enduring art. And you never know when something you do may hit the tipping point between the every-day and the extraordinary.*

What I took away from this fascinating tale about a songwriter and a band is that *persistence is the mother of serendipity*. The story of *Born To Be Wild* is a confluence of creativity, timing and talent. Two of the three factors are things each of us can develop. Add a ton of persistence and the ‚Äúluck‚Äù others often attribute to success is more likely to come your way.",Music,1558705198,W9WSW,0,1,True,2019-05-24

You're not listening to enough Booker T. &amp; The M.G.'s,"If you're a ""Millennial"" (and even if you aren't), you've probably seen the 1993 instant-classic The Sandlot. If so, you're familiar with a band called Booker T. &amp; The M.G.'s.

You know the scene where the opposing team with their actual uniforms and the kid with the punchable face roll up on bikes to confront the sandlot boys? That song is [Green Onions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gc_3Xpo9Z_Y), certainly the most famous song ever produced by the band. If this song doesn't directly play your little nostalgic heartstrings, then you're a can't-hack-it pantywaist who wears his mother's bra.

Now, some of you may be thinking ""Yeah, I've heard that song a million times, and I knew it was by Booker T. etc, what's your point?"" My point is that the rest of their discography is just as magical, but nowhere near as famous. First, a little history:

Booker T. &amp; The M.G.'s originated as the house band at Stax Records, meaning they played backing music for soul greats such as Otis Redding and Wilson Pickett. In 1962, the band started messing around in the studio with no goals other than jamming, but the engineer liked what he head so much that he started recording. Shortly thereafter, the band recorded two songs (one of which was Green Onions), and released their first single. The rest, as they say, is history. Notably, Booker T. &amp; The M.G's consists of two black men and two white men, making them one of the first interracial music groups in mainstream American history. 

Let's take a little trip through a personally curated list of just a fraction of the gems that this band pumped out over the years that you have been completely ignoring:

* [Behave Yourself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdVhIiPJohs): The B-side of Green Onions. Despite the title, this song doesn't sound like good behavior to me. This song screams ""I can't believe we got away with it."" This is a track you put on right as you take the first sip of whiskey after a successful heist with no witnesses. This song plays out of the sunrise as you stumble out of the party where you had your first threesome. It's pure victory.

* [Sunday Sermon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZeO2FY67LQ): Smooth and melodic, with a certain ineffable religious vibe despite total lack of lyrics. You could smoke a joint in church to this song. I play this song on Sunday mornings while cooking breakfast in lieu of believing in God. Put this bad boy on your poker playlist and then mock your friends for not knowing who Booker T. &amp; The M.G.'s are when they inevitably ask you what song it is.

[Day Tripper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9siljwfB_C4): Exactly what you think it is - an organ-based Beatles cover. Ideal for short drives on a weekend morning with the windows rolled halfway down. Must be wearing sunglasses to properly enjoy.

[Over Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vPjrE_9G084): Minimalist and jazzy, with some funky guitar riffs sliding in and out. This is a good walking song, particularly if you your have a small-caliber pistol in your pocket. A great soundtrack for doing drug deals in nice neighborhoods, or at least pretending that's why you're there.

[Soul Limbo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=se7Qss2WB40): I'm just gonna come right out and say it - this song is having an identity crisis. It sounds like a collab between The Ventures and Harry Belafonte. Despite the unclear genre, it's still upbeat and lighthearted, and would be right at home on any tropical vacation playlist. A little-known fact is that when this song is playing, an otherwise self-respecting man can order a rum runner.

[Mo' Onions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3AXwb7GL4-4): If you're the type of person who often finds themselves saying ""Yeah, but have you heard the remix?"", then this song is for you. I like to put this song on around people in their 60's and watch the gears turn until they eventually say ""This sounds like Green Onions"". You're right dad, it does sound like Green Onions. Take a wild guess as to who's playing that organ.

This concludes my essay on what I believe to be an under-appreciated band that truly impacted music for decades after their prime. All of these songs are available on Spotify, so get to adding them and feel free to comment with your favorites if you're already a fan.",Music,1558708371,TheMadFlyentist,10,17,True,2019-05-24

My best friend is a network engineer and a suburban father to a 5 y.o. He just quietly dropped this insanely good instrumental album that deserves more attention.,"He recorded and produced everything on his own, in his basement studio. He also made the album art. 

Seven Spirit is a 7 song album that is 49 minutes long so each song averages out to be 7 minutes exactly. The seven-pointed star is such a good visual for the sound. He wrote these songs over the span of a year and kept the songs in the order that he wrote them. So there is a maturity that you can hear from the beginning to the end as it ramps up to the final glorious song. Each track is completely different yet they all feel like they belong together. 

I really can't stop listening to it. So proud of him. Please show him some love, Reddit.

Wall of LP's - my 15 best albums of all time.,"Ok so, being of the Gen-X mould, I still have a few LP's hanging around but no record player anymore.

Tried Discogs and managed to flog a few if them off a while back.

 A chunk went to 3RRR because I owe so much to that freaking awesome radio station for widening my musical pallette over the years, leaving only albums like U2's - Joshua Tree and Dead Kennedy's - Give Me Death Or Give Me Convenience and a few others that  I still enjoy from time to time via Spotify.

Anyway, with those that remain, I am thinking that I will put them in frames and create my own #WallOfSound.

Problem is though, I only have 9 of the 15 proposed spaces filled.

So I thought I would reach out to y'all and see what your favourite ""albums"" of all time are?

Maybe through your responses I will be reminded of one long forgotten but worth a revisit or maybe I will take the plunge on one of your choices and hit GOLD!

All the reasons people claim rock is dead are false,"Reason 1: Kids don‚Äôt like music their parents listened to. 

Well if that‚Äôs the case what about girls who listen to Katy Perry today when their moms listened to Brittney Spears and that‚Äôs the same kind of music? Same for rap and hip hop. If their dad listened to Snoop Dogg why are they listening to Kane West? So if dads of today grew up on Foo Fighters then why can‚Äôt kids listen to Badflower? 


Reason 2: Because musical tastes change overtime. 

Then why are genres that were all around in the 80‚Äôs like pop, electronica, rap and hip hop dominating today?


Reason 3: Only white kids like it. 

Then why are there tons of Latino and Native American kids in Metallica shirts at your local high school? I do understand more white kids listen to rap then black kids listen to rock but there are black kids who like rock.



Reason 4: Rock‚Äôs lyrics are too depressive

If that‚Äôs the case why are party rock bands like Nickelback so hated? We have a nation of depressed people so Rock seems like it should be more relatable then the mindless happy pop of Taylor Swift and Lady Gaga.


Reason 5: Illegal downloads make it impossible for artists to make money off music

That isn‚Äôt stopping Ariana Grande, Justin Bieber and Kendrick Lamar.


Reason 6: It‚Äôs cheaper to make pop and rap because you can use a computer instead of a guitar.


Why is that a barrier when the cheap MacBooks cost $1,500? They can spend hundreds more on software and microphones and other equipment but a guitar or drum set is too expensive? 


Reason 7: Because rock fans are too picky and gate keepish over their definition of rock.

That didn‚Äôt stop Linkin Park selling millions of albums. 


Real reason? Women. 

Women have more buying power than men and they like rock less than pop, electronic, hip hop and rap because those genres are easier to dance too and sing along with. Rock is more of a masculine catering genre as it has a raw and louder sound and it‚Äôs more serious and less fun. This is why advertisers don‚Äôt use rock in commercials and movies anymore. This is why the Grammys don‚Äôt mention rock and leave it off their show. Because men have the audacity to spend less money than women.",Music,1556092700,alexfromnorwalk,2,0,True,2019-04-24

Kanye was putting out solid tracks consistently and was arguably at the peak of his career creatively. Yeah, fun times. Late 2000s may pale in comparison to the 70s or 80s, but it was still good.

"Music is subjective, so why not give underground artists a chance?"," 

Getting people to listen to music they have never heard of before, is a very difficult thing to do. It is like pulling teeth. If you are someone that loves music, why do you avoid unknown artists? Do you just not know how to find them?

&amp;#x200B;

From what I have seen, there are a lot of musicians out there that make amazing music! I was searching through soundcloud, and it startles me, to hear such good music... and to see that these people have very few plays on the song. In some cases I was the first to listen to it! There are tons of promotion companies trying to make money off of these people! They approach artists with promises of people hearing their music! Underground Artists, new and old, just do not have anywhere they can go, that they can get people to listen to their music. They are backed into a corner, and they feel they must pay money. As a result, people who avoid this stuff go completely unnoticed... which is a pity because their music comes from their heart! Not to make money, but to express themselves... all they want is for people to be interested and to listen!

&amp;#x200B;

I have been told that the reason no one listens to underground artists is simply because the majority of music is bad or poorly produced. To that I say, music is one of the most subjective things ever. I have a long list of popular artists that I do not like, and I know that I am not alone. The problem isn't the music, the problem is the fact that very few people are listening and interacting.

&amp;#x200B;

On Reddit, people looking to share their music are often met with silence! [r/ThisIsOurMusic](https://new.reddit.com/r/ThisIsOurMusic) is the biggest sub for self-promotion, but with no comment requirement, people regularly promote themselves and then just leave! They have little/no interest in listening to other peoples music! TIOM is THE place to go to promote your music. That is why it is filled with self promoters and not filled with listeners/commenters. Self promoters need a bit of incentive to listen! From what I have found, self promoters are willing to give other artists their time and feedback, if it means they too will be given that same thing.

&amp;#x200B;

In response to this, 2 months ago I jump started a music subreddit that has a 3 comment requirement. This makes artists 3 times more likely to get feedback on their music, than on any of the other 500 music subreddits. Since then over 2,000 people have joined and posted hundreds of songs; and I have listened to hundreds of songs... In my opinion, there are a lot of songs out there, that people are missing out on.

&amp;#x200B;

Don't believe me? Below are a few examples:

[Crw\_vrth ‚Äì Middle](https://soundcloud.com/crw_vrth/middle) \[Instrumental\]

&amp;#x200B;

I believe that artists need a place to go, that they know will give them a chance, that doesn't cost money. Maybe after going there, and getting good enough feedback, they can decide if it is a good idea to financially invest in their music. Likewise, they can decide that they are not ""in it for the money"" and continue share their music with a small community for free.

&amp;#x200B;

[r/IndieMusicFeedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieMusicFeedback) (IMF) was created for this purpose. Indie stands for artists that are Independent of a record label, so all genre's are welcomed!

&amp;#x200B;

**DISCLAIMER**: This isn't going to give anyone fame or money. If you are interested in making it big, the best way to do that is to invest money into promotion. However, you might want to test your music with some other underground artists over at IMF before taking that step.

&amp;#x200B;

Here is a great example, of someone that might consider investing money into his music.

[u/](https://www.reddit.com/u/Adrianavarromusic) [**Adriannavarromusic**](https://new.reddit.com/user/Adriannavarromusic)

This person has been posting his music to Reddit for 3 months. He tried a total of 11 music subreddits, getting only 2 comments between them all.

6 days ago, he posted at [r/indiemusicfeedback](https://www.reddit.com/r/indiemusicfeedback), and has gotten himself 30 comments, and 22 upvotes. This is exactly the type of artist that might consider investing money into his music. But without anyone listening to underground music, how could he have known how much people love his music?

Source( [https://new.reddit.com/r/IndieMusicFeedback/comments/bd35ja/would\_you\_listen\_to\_this/](https://new.reddit.com/r/IndieMusicFeedback/comments/bd35ja/would_you_listen_to_this/) )

And what about the artist that doesn't have any potential following? That musician could spend hundreds of dollars before realizing this reality.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Have you ever wondered what the chances are of getting feedback at [r/ThisIsOurMusic](https://www.reddit.com/r/ThisIsOurMusic) (TIOM)? I think the numbers really speak for themselves:

TIOM (32k subs) on Saturday 4/20: 57 total posts and 53 total comments.

IMF (3k subs) on Saturday 4/20: 81 total posts and over 500 comments.

This is hard to believe, so I video recorded myself counting the numbers as proof( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP8ty...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP8tyZDaIrA) )

&amp;#x200B;

TIOM had 28 less posts, and it is unfair to compare them in this way. **Let's compare their comment to post ratios instead**. At TIOM, there were 57 posts to 53 comments. **The ratio is less than 1**.

On IMF, there were 81 posts to over 500 comments... 500/81 = 6.17! **A ratio of 6**! People were actually 6 times more likely to get feedback on Saturday at IMF than at TIOM.

The artists at IMF are really going above and beyond! In just two months, they have completely changed how self promoters are approaching sharing their music at Reddit. However, there is no denying that people at IMF still are at risk of not getting any feedback. If people are still not getting feedback, even with such a high comment to post ratio, **imagine how low the chances are of getting feedback, when the ratio is below 1.**

&amp;#x200B;

If self promoters act as listeners, they will change how they approach sharing their music with one another. But what about the people out there who just love music? What keeps those people from giving underground musicians a shot? Is it because people do not know how to find underground musicians? Are there just not enough platforms out there, that showcase music in an unbiased ways?",Music,1556104412,Pax_Libertas,11,11,True,2019-04-24

https://youtu.be/_P0ZYMH3DO8

Long story short, I quit my job working for a major tech company last September as I was becoming increasingly disillusioned with the corporate game. Decided to move to Barcelona (I'm European) and try to dedicate my life to something I'm passionate about, music. One thing led to another and I ended up meeting this local band called WESPHERE. I immediately loved their sound, saw their potential and encouraged them to release new music in 2019. I've been working as their manager since then and Swimming Deeply is the first track off the EP we'll release in June. So far, reception has been good but slow. Getting noticed amidst the avalanche of releases is quite hard but I believe the band deserves to be heard, which is why I'm here today.

"I arranged for 13 Cellos Song Of Durin (Lord Of The Rings), here is the result ! (100+ hours of work)","Video : [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKVHQ2u3FWo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKVHQ2u3FWo)

I am in love with Tolkien World, Lord of the Rings books, films, &amp; soundtrack.

Song Of Durin was composed by Clamavi de Profundis, an awesome singer band doing Cover &amp; Original composition around Tolkien Universe. I am a huge fan of the original music, so I decided to make the Cello Cover for 13 Cellos.

This music fits perfectly with the deep warm &amp; mysterious sound of the Cello. There are 7 differents parts, all played twice except the Melody (in the big central screen).

2 Cellos are doing the lower bass (on the down side corner), holding a single deep note : Bb on the C string (I use a scordatura = detune the cello to gain access to lower note than on a normal cello)

2 Cellos are doing the upper bass (on the left side)

2 Cellos are doing the tenor (on the right side)

4 Cellos are doing the alto (on the top side, split into 2)

And finally, 2 cellos are doing drums, I had to remix &amp; change a lot the sound to make the sound better :)

A huge thanks to Clamavi De Profundis for creating this awesome music &amp; for sharing for free the sheet music (available in description)

Thanks everyone, hope you enjoyed this one !Ôªø",Music,1553479589,Cellofrag_____,1,4,True,2019-03-24

I'm at a loss trying to search for this song,"I'm at a loss trying to search for this extremely rare song. I remember when my cousins and I were kids (about 8-13 years old in the late 80s/early 90s), my uncle had a cassette tape that had various artists and songs on it. I think either he or someone else recorded them onto a tape, so it may not have been a particular album, just a mixed tape. It had ""Walk Like a Man"", ""Amadeus"", some other songs I don't care to recall, and then this mysterious song I've been trying to remember. The weirdest shit ever. All my cousins and I remember about it was a duck quacking or rapping (we believe Donald Duck's voice), and a chicken going ""puk puk puk pukaaaaaaak, puk puk puk pukaaaaaaak"". It's not Disco Duck, we already confirmed that. I've entered so many various search quotes, keywords, you name it. It's driving me nuts and my OCD won't let me stop. If anyone out there has any idea what it might be, please please please tell me.

ALBUM: OFFSET - FATHER OF 4 (DOWNLOAD/STREAM),"**Offset Father of 4 Album Download Zip Mp3**¬†‚Äì Offset‚Äôs [album](http://gidi9ja.com/album/album-offset-father-of-4/)  has been one of the most anticipated album in the hiphop culture last  year and this year, after promising it‚Äôs release and failing on so many  occasions, we are super excited to inform you that the album is  available right here for your [downloading](http://gidi9ja.com/album/album-offset-father-of-4/) pleasure.

Offset‚Äôs new album has arrived. Listen to Father of 4 below in full.  The Migos rapper‚Äôs first solo effort features Cardi B, Travis Scott, 21  Savage, J. Cole, Gucci Mane, Quavo, and more. He teased the album during  the 2019 Grammys with footage of Cardi B giving birth to their  daughter, Kulture (who appears on the album cover).

Father of 4 was originally set to drop on December 14 but was  postponed without explanation. The album‚Äôs ‚ÄúRed Room‚Äù surfaced on  streaming platforms last year, but was later removed. Offset recently  shared the visuals for the newly-dropped single.

Offset is the last member of Migos to share a solo project behind  Takeoff‚Äôs The Last Rocket and Quavo‚Äôs QUAVO HUNCHO. In 2017, Offset  joined 21 Savage and [Metro](http://gidi9ja.com/album/album-offset-father-of-4/) Boomin for the collaborative project Without Warning. Migos‚Äô last release as a group was 2018‚Äôs Culture II.

Nicki Minaj apologized to fans after cancelling her show on tour,"The #NickiWRLDTour had a show last night in Slovakia but it had been cancelled because the building didn't have enough power to lift her music equipments. 

She changed her clothes, came out with her fans, said sorry to all of them, sang with them (without music) on stage and promised to comeback one day. The fans will get their refund soon. After making an annoucement, she went backstage and took pictures, shaken her fans hands and try to sorry as much as she can. I really love her because this is a professional way to deal with an cancelled show. 

![video](e8xd0mqjo8i21)

The apologise had been updated on her instagram: ""Gutted. Heart broken. I can‚Äôt believe my fans sometimes. After waiting for hours &amp; hours, they still tried to be understanding. Production was told the building does not have the power to facilitate my lifts (which don‚Äôt only move me below &amp; very VERY high above the stage, but also move all our props, furniture, dancers, band, etc.), our lighting rig, fog, cryo, confetti, movies/visuals. They‚Äôd get the show powered up then the breaker would basically trip after a few mins. Juice WRLD &amp; I waited while they did this over &amp; over for 3 hours. Some of my fans came from Austria, Nigeria, etc. I met w/a lot of them &amp; they had the best, sweetest energy. I‚Äôm so disappointed. Slovakia, I love you so much &amp; I‚Äôll do everything in my power to get back to you as soon as I can. I think the venue/promo team probably didn‚Äôt expect a rap show to have such over the top production. We run the risk of someone getting hurt if we start the show &amp; smthng malfunctions mid-show. Sorry we couldn‚Äôt have a great night together. We‚Äôll be in Poland on Sunday @ a building that can facilitate our show. ‚ô•Ô∏èüôèüèΩ""

Inspired by listening to Alice Cooper *Goes to Hell* this evening, where the sleeve clearly signals the moment of his transition from 'menacing/sinister' to 'spooky dad'.

A few more from me - The Marked Men have put out uniformly great records with not an attractive sleeve in the bunch. *Ghosts* in particular looks like someone's cousin-with-a-color-printer designed it.

*Warchild* by Jethro Tull has a terrible cover.

Special category for early-90s grunge records that give you that feeling of unexpected-vhs-nudity-with-yr-parents-in-the-room even when you listen to them all by yrself as an adult like *Nevermind* or *Bakesale* or *Sexy Pee Story*.

"Why is there ""symmetry in rhythms""?","See picture.

&amp;#x200B;

It almost seems like every rhythm that is commonly used can be divided by certain numbers and result in either a full number or a specific number that is also seen more than just once.

&amp;#x200B;

If you have software that can play music at a certain BPM you can even try it yourself and set it to a rhythm that is irregular and it will just sound, well... dull, compared to the other rhythms.

"I need artist recommendations! I'd love to listen to a female artist, high voice, rather unedited voice, and very relaxing/soothing melodic songs.","I just love female voices in music, especially with a high tone and nice melodics to it. But not too loud of a music, sometimes just playing the guitar or piano silently in the back with a nice melody is more than enough.

A good example would probably be my all time favorite artist Avril Lavigne, who has lots of songs where she just sings melodic to her playing the guitar which I really love. I love her chorus'es too but I don't need it that pop~rockish. It just really works for her.

Another example would be the song Skylar Grey - Only Thing I Hear. Actually, Coming Home, Back From The Dead and Tower are pretty fine songs of her too. She has a really nice voice on these and they are rather relaxing. Sadly these are already most songs I like of her and I tried her other songs but they aren't really mine. Religion was an okay song ig. But yea, thats that.

So yeah, any female artists who sing very soothing to melodic songs? Basically like lullabies?~ Well, doesnt have to be lullabies. But you get what I mean now I think. :&gt;",Music,1550931624,Wmbd,8,1,True,2019-02-23

Who is your favorite band/singer?  
What is your favorite album?  
What is your favorite song?

They don't have to be from the same artist.

My favorite trip hop band is Zero 7.   
My favorite trip hop album is Soon It Will Be Cold Enough by Emancipator. The vinyl release is superb! When I listen to the CD in the car, I never skip a track. To me, that's the sign of a near-perfect album! It's the same with Coldplay's Parachutes, for example.   
My favorite trip hop song is Slowly by Max Sedgley.

Now for something completely different - My style of playlists,"So this is something probably a bit different to what‚Äôs on here mostly in regards to Spotify playlists.   
I have always made mix tapes growing up and i really like limitations of both creating and listening to the medium.   
Since 2008 when I first got a laptop I started making playlist on itunes like the rest of us but I still always liked how tapes felt to use, especially in a social environment. I would record it onto the tape with the boombox and an aux cord. All our friends did the same which meant that when we would hang out we each have a great selection of music to share but also develop patience in listening. It seems that as a symptom of easier access to music and ease of use, people get feature DJ Next (aka skipping the fuck out of songs) whenever they play music.  
These days I don‚Äôt bother exporting it onto tapes but still make a shit ton of playlists which the mix tape idea in mind. I always try and use a few basic concepts when putting the playlists together which i‚Äôll go into more detail below. However, at the of the day there is so much wank bullshit justifications behind art and music that I just make the playlists because I like doing it and i like sharing it with people.

&amp;#x200B;

1) A tape has a set order. There is no shuffle setting and to listen to the tracks out of order is such a waste of time that you would pretty much never bother. This forces the creator of the tape to think more about the overall energy, tempo even the key the songs are in. Another example of this would be the process of pieces and album together as tracks are written or a DJ set.   
2) A tape has a set length. You can only chose the songs that are outstanding and fit into your concept of the mix tape. The end product being a collection of music that are not only individually outstanding music but also each track fits into the others. Although In the case of these playlists I haven‚Äôt limited myself to any set time but the average time for each playlist is around 1.5 hours which i realised later is very close to the length of the old tapes - 90 minutes.

3) A tape is static. After the tapes were made, we never recorded over them again. At some point the playlist was finished and we never changed it. In the same way once im done with a playlist I don‚Äôt update it or change it.  
4) Each tape is fresh. Part of sharing the music was that each person was trying to find stuff that the rest of us would frof. It felt good to be the one to find some mind blowing tracks that the group loved. The music didn‚Äôt have to be recently released, just new to us. This meant that each tape was unique to the last as you didn‚Äôt want to spend your short tape realestate with tracks you already had on tapes.   
So below is a bunch of playlists I have made in Spotify over the past 2 years. Each playlist is unique in the way that a song will only appear once throughout all the playlists. I have heaps more playlists on itunes from the previous 8 years or so but unfortunately heaps of the tracks aren‚Äôt on Spotify so there they shall remain for now.

This playlists was made for/on the train trip we took between Vancouver and Jasper in the dead of the Canadian winter. It was also surprising fitting for the time we spend in Yellowknife while the average daytime temperature was -40 Centigrade. The name is an anagram of Afterglow which was a playlist my friend gave me before I went to Europe and Africa for the first time in 2011. I listened to it on trains in the middle of the european winter and I still think it was the playlist that opened my eyes to music more than anything before or after. There a few tracks on this playlist by artists that feature in Afterglow as a nice throwback. Also, a second meaning to the name is my sisters middle name, Dega, which means wolf in Inuit because she was born in Canada, however, she had never returned till now.

This one is made for sitting in the sun on a Cambodian beach with nothing else to do. I started learning about this music from a DJ at work and build this playlist around some vinyls he showed me. A bit different than anything else I had done before but i really like how it turned out.   


\[Mahendraparvata\]([https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/305NjlYhH9ofMh1LiQ94cd?si=U\_fBqcT2QS-qipdfD7RmTA](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/305NjlYhH9ofMh1LiQ94cd?si=U_fBqcT2QS-qipdfD7RmTA)) **- Imaginary Soundtrack/Drum and Bass**  
Djrum‚Äôs mix ‚Äú*Soundtrack to an Imaginary Film‚Äù* is a lovely title and is also a great way of describing this playlist. I tried to keep the epic strings and energetic drums front and centre but also with a sprinkle of Drum and Bass to add a darker element. The basic setting of this imaginary film takes place ‚ÄúIn an artificial universe contained within an ancient space station orbiting a distant star‚Äù. I made this once while spending time in Cambodia.

I made this playlist for no other reason besides just wanting a bunch of really good hip hop to listen to. It‚Äôs mostly instrumental but there‚Äôs a couple of really good verses in there too. The name is a reference to a Workaholics episode.  
\[Mindfield\]([https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/4hqUAI3NEKIGPvvSghld4m?si=JO9WbhQYSUmTJacbE1pyPA](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/4hqUAI3NEKIGPvvSghld4m?si=JO9WbhQYSUmTJacbE1pyPA)) **- Electronic/IDM/House/Disco/Downtempo**   
I was moving apart from my girlfriend and was trying to work out what to do with my life. I made this playlist as a kind of revitaliser - something to start you off in the day. It begins chilled and melancholy but constantly builds in mood and tempo. It‚Äôs a it‚Äôs a big warm music hug on a bad day,  
\[Epilectric Dogs\]([https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/7tDxnxrQpbuVLhfL6PCQCf?si=Spv6oF\_eS3Si6F9Ov7KKUA](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/7tDxnxrQpbuVLhfL6PCQCf?si=Spv6oF_eS3Si6F9Ov7KKUA)) **- Instrumental Hip Hop**  
I was living in a sharehouse with B-grade celebrity that would have cocaine filled orgies in the room next to mine. As a result me and the one other housemate would spent a lot of time smoking and freestyling in the shed. These were some of these best tracks from that era.   
\[Simboratus\]([https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/5dRETvlZ1HGZVVHbfu5YT2?si=FjUryNoUS8aLkJVvJ6Z8iw](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/5dRETvlZ1HGZVVHbfu5YT2?si=FjUryNoUS8aLkJVvJ6Z8iw)) **- Imaginary Soundtrack/Drum and Bass/LoFi Hip Hop/Dub/Ambient/House** 

This playlist was made in the dead of winter in Melbourne and it was cold as fuck that year, not to mention spending most of out time in the shed. I worked on this playlist after 14 hours shifts at nightclubs ending at 7am in the morning. The vibe for it was that pervasive half awake half asleep feeling that I would experience all too often during that time.  
\[‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚ñ¶‚ñ¶‚ñ§‚ñ§‚ñ©‚ñ©‚ñ£‚ñ£‚äô‚ñ∫‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°\]([https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/0MoNesCd9uHU1hDcyUdDjG?si=Lb6zgD1XT-akjbNEDH8dGw](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/0MoNesCd9uHU1hDcyUdDjG?si=Lb6zgD1XT-akjbNEDH8dGw)) **- Electronic/IDM/House/Downtempo**   
This playlist just kind of came about one morning after my dad told me he could get time off work to come travelling in Canada with me and my sister. He wanted to travel by train so I made a playlist for traveling on trains, which is something I always love doing.

My girlfriend came over and mentioned I had a Daybed in my room (it‚Äôs a little couch built into the window with curtains, if that makes sense) but I thought she said ‚ÄúDavid‚Äù. From then on it was known as the David and we spend a lot of time smoking with the curtain drawn behind us thus spawning the phase ‚Äúto enter the David‚Äù. This playlist is just a bunch of really good house music we listened to in the David.   


\[Prababalaty\]([https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/7flK4XcmBafTRfmZUmjgnG?si=wUpk-4FMQSeJUNOaAprFXA](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/7flK4XcmBafTRfmZUmjgnG?si=wUpk-4FMQSeJUNOaAprFXA)) **- Electronic/IDM/Downtempo** 

Every spring it rains a lot in southern Australia. I think it‚Äôs the nicest time of year not too hot, not too cold and not too windy. This playlist is just about the water and the rains and the feeling at that time of year.   


\[Precious Dad\]([https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/5GXwsAAaoWWLdFWHZtaZvi?si=AqWDtnibQOeLHzVBoEtJFw](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/5GXwsAAaoWWLdFWHZtaZvi?si=AqWDtnibQOeLHzVBoEtJFw)) **- Instrumental Hip Hop** 

I made this one for a camping trip with some old mates from the tape days.   
My mate calls ‚ÄúPrecious Earth‚Äù, the cheapest wine from Aldi, Precious Dad.

A collection of the years worth of vocal hip hop. One of my favourite playlists from 2017. Made for the smashing VBs over summer and hanging out till 8am on city rooftops after work.

On our trip to Canada I ended up going on 16 different planes trips so I made this playlist to just zone out to while traveling. I kinda imagine Nicholas Cage as a time travelling wizard who is just having a laugh before he fucks off back to 1400s, aka Nikolai.

I made this as a soundtrack to play Burnout Takedown to. Also works on Halo and Dirt. Not a playlist I listen to often but when you are in the right mood it‚Äôs a cranker.

After moving into an awesome house in a sick area and not having too much to worry about I found myself loving instrumental hip hop more than ever so I made some more playlists. The best instrumental beats I found from the first part of 2018  
\[Vandemonian\]([https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/05j3DOYhor3XBzVe0o5Ql3?si=oiQA3jb5ScyP1Njc6KjfiQ](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/05j3DOYhor3XBzVe0o5Ql3?si=oiQA3jb5ScyP1Njc6KjfiQ)) **- Imaginary Soundtrack/Drum and Bass/Ambient** 

There is an island at the end of the world covered in forest surrounded by nothing but ocean for hundreds of kilometres. I made this playlist inspired by growing up in Tasmania and the absolute isolation of the place that I have become more aware of after living away from it for so long. A Vandemonian was the name of the citizens of Van Diemen‚Äôs land, the original name for Tasmania.

Although In the case of these playlists I haven‚Äôt limited myself to any set time but the average time for each playlist is around 1.5 hours which i realised later is very close to the length of the old tapes - 90 minutes.

3) A tape is static. After the tapes were made, we never recorded over them again. At some point the playlist was finished and we never changed it. In the same way once im done with a playlist I don‚Äôt update it or change it.  
4) Each tape is fresh. Part of sharing the music was that each person was trying to find stuff that the rest of us would frof. It felt good to be the one to find some mind blowing tracks that the group loved. The music didn‚Äôt have to be recently released, just new to us. This meant that each tape was unique to the last as you didn‚Äôt want to spend your short tape realestate with tracks you already had on tapes.   
So below is a bunch of playlists I have made in Spotify over the past 2 years. Each playlist is unique in the way that a song will only appear once throughout all the playlists. I have heaps more playlists on itunes from the previous 8 years or so but unfortunately heaps of the tracks aren‚Äôt on Spotify so there they shall remain for now.

[Great Wolf](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/4vweEeWK2jUTmpzWUP20d2?si=xNNa4JB-Qt2nLyyGasiWhg) **- Dub/IDM/Drum and Bass/Imaginary Soundtrack**  
This playlists was made for/on the train trip we took between Vancouver and Jasper in the dead of the Canadian winter. It was also surprising fitting for the time we spend in Yellowknife while the average daytime temperature was -40 Centigrade. The name is an anagram of Afterglow which was a playlist my friend gave me before I went to Europe and Africa for the first time in 2011. I listened to it on trains in the middle of the European winter and I still think it was the playlist that opened my eyes to music more than anything before or after. There a few tracks on this playlist by artists that feature in Afterglow as a nice throwback. Also, a second meaning to the name is my sisters middle name, Dega, which means wolf in Inuit because she was born in Canada, however, she had never returned till then.   


[Sun Soaked Wendy](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/56EhdyeHrwnzUCpsucFA2W?si=H3pnBVk6TtKpAuoziSYqGQ) **- LoFi/Hip Hop/Reggae/Dub**

This one is made for sitting in the sun on a Cambodian beach with nothing else to do. I started learning about this music from a DJ at work and build this playlist around some vinyls he showed me. A bit different than anything else I had done before but i really like how it turned out.   


[Mahendraparvata](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/305NjlYhH9ofMh1LiQ94cd?si=U_fBqcT2QS-qipdfD7RmTA) **- Imaginary Soundtrack/Drum and Bass**  
Djrum‚Äôs mix ‚Äú*Soundtrack to an Imaginary Film‚Äù* is a lovely title and is also a great way of describing this playlist. I tried to keep the epic strings and energetic drums front and centre but also with a sprinkle of Drum and Bass to add a darker element. The basic setting of this imaginary film takes place ‚ÄúIn an artificial universe contained within an ancient space station orbiting a distant star‚Äù. I made this once while spending time in Cambodia. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Deny The Prophecy](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/2hqKRrMuPyU6mfvxHtu6bK?si=AHVJmpMgRUWtFfBDEzwrFw) **- Hip Hop/LoFi/Instrumental**

I made this playlist for no other reason besides just wanting a bunch of really good hip hop to listen to. It‚Äôs mostly instrumental but there‚Äôs a couple of really good verses in there too. The name is a reference to a Workaholics episode.  
[Mindfield](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/4hqUAI3NEKIGPvvSghld4m?si=JO9WbhQYSUmTJacbE1pyPA) **- Electronic/IDM/House/Disco/Downtempo**   
I was moving apart from my girlfriend and was trying to work out what to do with my life. I made this playlist as a kind of revitaliser - something to start you off in the day. It begins chilled and melancholy but constantly builds in mood and tempo. It‚Äôs a it‚Äôs a big warm music hug on a bad day,  
[Epilectric Dogs](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/7tDxnxrQpbuVLhfL6PCQCf?si=Spv6oF_eS3Si6F9Ov7KKUA) **- Instrumental Hip Hop**  
I was living in a sharehouse with B-grade celebrity that would have cocaine filled orgies in the room next to mine. As a result me and the one other housemate would spent a lot of time smoking and freestyling in the shed. These were some of these best tracks from that era.   
[Simboratus](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/5dRETvlZ1HGZVVHbfu5YT2?si=FjUryNoUS8aLkJVvJ6Z8iw) **- Imaginary Soundtrack/Drum and Bass/LoFi Hip Hop/Dub/Ambient/House** 

This playlist was made in the dead of winter in Melbourne and it was cold as fuck that year, not to mention spending most of out time in the shed. I worked on this playlist after 14 hours shifts at nightclubs ending at 7am in the morning. The vibe for it was that pervasive half awake half asleep feeling that I would experience all too often during that time.  
[‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚ñ¶‚ñ¶‚ñ§‚ñ§‚ñ©‚ñ©‚ñ£‚ñ£‚äô‚ñ∫‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°‚Ä°](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/0MoNesCd9uHU1hDcyUdDjG?si=Lb6zgD1XT-akjbNEDH8dGw) **- Electronic/IDM/House/Downtempo**   
This playlist just kind of came about one morning after my dad told me he could get time off work to come travelling in Canada with me and my sister. He wanted to travel by train so I made a playlist for traveling on trains, which is something I always love doing.

&amp;#x200B;

[Enter the David](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/36ybqRykldpzSawe1nb3ho?si=DE-1oLRBR5yRrnpgUafvaw) **- House/Detroit House** 

My girlfriend came over and mentioned I had a Daybed in my room (it‚Äôs a little couch built into the window with curtains, if that makes sense) but I thought she said ‚ÄúDavid‚Äù. From then on it was known as the David and we spend a lot of time smoking with the curtain drawn behind us thus spawning the phase ‚Äúto enter the David‚Äù. This playlist is just a bunch of really good house music we listened to in the David.   


[Prababalaty](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/7flK4XcmBafTRfmZUmjgnG?si=wUpk-4FMQSeJUNOaAprFXA) **- Electronic/IDM/Downtempo** 

Every spring it rains a lot in southern Australia. I think it‚Äôs the nicest time of year not too hot, not too cold and not too windy. This playlist is just about the water and the rains and the feeling at that time of year.   


[Precious Dad](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/5GXwsAAaoWWLdFWHZtaZvi?si=AqWDtnibQOeLHzVBoEtJFw) **- Instrumental Hip Hop** 

I made this one for a camping trip with some old mates from the tape days.   
My mate calls ‚ÄúPrecious Earth‚Äù, the cheapest wine from Aldi, Precious Dad.  


[‚ùÇ](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/1JCCG9QngBeCNLD2h5bnMb?si=A1QpM1pxQrirQvWDLsaiMA) **- Hip hop**

A collection of the years worth of vocal hip hop. One of my favourite playlists from 2017. Made for the smashing VBs over summer and hanging out till 8am on city rooftops after work.

&amp;#x200B;

[‚ìÉikolai](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/7dZk0L6kO8wufBbTEZEyCB?si=VPM8aPs2Qc2VOUYnoa-bkQ) \- Downtempo/Ambient   
On our trip to Canada I ended up going on 16 different planes trips so I made this playlist to just zone out to while traveling. I kinda imagine Nicholas Cage as a time travelling wizard who is just having a laugh before he fucks off back to 1400s, aka Nikolai.   
[·¥∑·¥ø·¥¨·µë·¥∑·¥±·¥∫‚Ç©‚Ç≥‚Ç≤‚Ç¨‚Ç¶](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/5izZRFtk3wTY4a2xGQNY38?si=_tUDuuncSnm3rBUMqY3epg) **- Drum and Bass**   
I made this as a soundtrack to play Burnout Takedown to. Also works on Halo and Dirt. Not a playlist I listen to often but when you are in the right mood it‚Äôs a cranker.   


[Curved Yellow Fruits](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/22DjfSDiTLOKINim4R2q1x?si=ZO13U1WMQleNzAThQ4cwxA) **- Instrumental Hip Hop**

After moving into an awesome house in a sick area and not having too much to worry about I found myself loving instrumental hip hop more than ever so I made some more playlists. The best instrumental beats I found from the first part of 2018  
[Vandemonian](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/05j3DOYhor3XBzVe0o5Ql3?si=oiQA3jb5ScyP1Njc6KjfiQ) **- Imaginary Soundtrack/Drum and Bass/Ambient** 

There is an island at the end of the world covered in forest surrounded by nothing but ocean for hundreds of kilometres. I made this playlist inspired by growing up in Tasmania and the absolute isolation of the place that I have become more aware of after living away from it for so long. A Vandemonian was the name of the citizens of Van Diemen‚Äôs land, the original name for Tasmania. 

&amp;#x200B;

[Lilly](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/7BzFO1SNHnBrYi50bPlWhr?si=xNhi9t4qQauJvoGSVmMrIQ) **- Indi/Disco**  
There‚Äôs very small selection of this genre of music I find that I really like. This is some of the best of it. I made this while stressed as fuck about my research and thesis.

&amp;#x200B;

[Ovoid of Water](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/3hLfvAzJ3AHNXNlg7lc1Wz?si=mvv7a0mTRKG3ZHuozvcquw)**- Instrumental hip hop**

One of my favourite things to do is freestyle to myself when i‚Äôm in the car or at home alone, i don‚Äôt have many friends who live in this city. This is the best instrumental hip hop of my spring.   
[Astro Nomer](https://open.spotify.com/user/mengibus/playlist/2PrSl5jE2E2mjdPsNVZoWl?si=iNhAGCHnSCWgGd83jzjXkQ) **- Hip Hop**

I made this one centred around good underground vocal hip hop from the US and UK. Good for putting on after work on the rooftop bar after all the customers have fucked off.

I'm fucking tired of this Spotify inequality.,"The Post Malone description ([https://i.imgur.com/d5CSmFa.png](https://i.imgur.com/d5CSmFa.png)) is just one example of many, but Spotify is fucking over small artists in countless ways, and I think it's time we took a stand and made it so that artists get paid .01 cents per stream. 

Yep, you fuckin heard me. That means that every 1,000,000 streams, an artist gets paid $10,000. Spotify is such a fucking rip off for artists that even this is cutting it low. People deserve more, and Spotify deserves less. The fact that Spotify is a multi-billion dollar company and just sits back and watches small artists struggle to make it is sickening.

Another example of this inequality is the fact that rich bitches like Drake have paid Spotify ([https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/03/spotify-users-push-back-at-the-over-the-top-drake-promotion/](https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/03/spotify-users-push-back-at-the-over-the-top-drake-promotion/)) to promote themselves way more than small artists could ever afford to do. It's ridiculous and unfair. 

Anyways, I'm just tired of all this. The music deserves to be paid well, otherwise small artists won't even try to make it.

Searching for a guitar player on Irma Thomas record.,"Hey everyone,

So I'm what they call a crate digger. This means that I look for albums/singles that aren't as popular as they deserve to be. I love doing it and finding a new gem is amazing. I don't know if this is the right subreddit to ask this but I thought I'd give it a shot. So let's get straight to the point. About two years ago I came across an Irma Thomas record. It's called ""Wish someone would care"". Released in 1964. It's one of my favourite albums. Especially one song which is covered by other artists like Gary Moore, Peter Green from Fleetwood Mac and the original by Little Willie John in 1955. It's called ""I need your love so bad"". I love the blues so this is a classic song for me. But there are many versions but the one by Irma Thomas is by far my favourite. On this record Irma is singing and there is a mysterious guitar player which I cannot find the name of. I've checked everything on the internet at the best of my knowledge. I thought maybe you guys will know something. I've been looking for this guitar player a while now and I just can't seem to get any further. It would mean alot if you guys could come forward with some tips or answers! ",Music,1548332853,arrowhopper,1,1,True,2019-01-24

Best Kanye Album?,"Mine would have to be a tie between Graduation and MBDTF. Of course MBDTF has the crazy production &amp; theatrical, euphoric experience, but Graduation has the unforgettable OG Kanye jams like Everything I Am, Drunk and Hot Girls, Good Morning, Champion, I Wonder, etc. Only complaint about Graduation is the Lil Wayne feat.  

TLOP is also pretty good. Ye, to me, is reminiscent of MBDTF.

A Gonzo experience,

of creation under the influence of alcohol

in high doses and without any refinement.

The melodies that compose it

have been designed with a few grams

ethanol but also freedom.

The one that tumbles, when drunkenness

an evening of debauchery to drink

picons let you burst the belly.

But do not think that this album

is devoid of tenderness or delicacy,

under this look of foolish gift

hides a crowd of the best feelings

""Qui vide son verre vide son c≈ìur"" V. HUGO

A very unlikely question,"Hey r/music, you're my last hope..
There's an extremely vague and ultimately unhelpful and unlikely question I have for you wonderful people, that involves finding a band with little to no information: all I can remember is that the band/song I'm trying to find is a old-ish techno-ish song, it's a rather confident (""you can't beat me"" kind of thing) song kind of in the same vein as Celldweller or Blue Stahli, but the most actually relevant information I can give you, is I vaguely remember the album art being a dark black/greenish tone, featuring an older, almost decaying looking building in the background, with a barrel (it may have a toxic symbol on it) in the foreground, and a bright bug or animal on the barrel.
I'm not expecting much success here, but I figured you lovely people would be my best chance at finding this band/song that's been vaguely in my mind for the past week.
I remember I loved it, but for the life of me can't remember what it was.
Again, sorry for the little-to-no information to go off of, but I figured you guys would be my only hope of finally remembering this band.

In the states was on high amounts of jack daniels. If I‚Äôm correct. Then the following scenario might of caused his death he went to Paris slowed or even stopped drinking , was on heroin though sedative keep tremendous some wat at bay but not enough. He went to a pub drunk a beer to stop the fits and alcohol withdrawals and then done big no no with dt‚Äôs took cocain ( a stimulant) this would of skyrocket the tremens and sent him into cardiac arrest.

"I'm in a small, but emerging band from Philly. We just released our new single this week, would you give us your honest feedback?","Happy Sunday!
I'm in a band called  [Tiny Hueman](https://www.tinyhueman.com/). We released two EPs last year, both exceeding our expectations; our song [Hollowhead](https://open.spotify.com/track/3O9mb3ngddWj1uMoy97TSs?si=Tv1ISHu5T76ta2goluUoqA) has been streamed almost 100k times, has been featured on playlists like Alternative Press Music Discovery, and more. We've toured and played a ton of shows around Philly/Boston/NYC, and look forward to hitting other cities next year. 
Our song [Drift](https://open.spotify.com/track/0Xw4EIBkQZFQtsn1igZG1I?si=or0QvGDYQyKezhp_gKsn1g) was featured on VICELAND's Thrasher King Of The Road this past summer too!

We'd love for your honest feedback on our new song (constructive criticism always welcomed):

What song would give you the highest BAC?,"I am a new Health teacher and will be discussing alcohol with my students in the next week or so.  I had the idea of a mini lesson that would incorporate calculating a person's Blood Alcohol Concentration by playing a song that makes reference to drinking (ideally makes reference to specific beverages that were consumed).

My question is, what song would get you the drunkest if a person were to consume every beverage that is referenced?

My first thought was ""Tubthumping"" by Chumbawumba (""he drinks a Whiskey drink, he drinks a Vodka drink, he drinks a Lager drink, he drinks a Cider drink"").  In one chorus, that is a minimum of 3 oz. of Whiskey and Lager (assuming a shot for each), 12 oz. for the Lager drink and 12 oz. for the Cider drink (27 oz. per chorus).  With two choruses in the song, this hypothetical person would have consumed 54 oz. of alcohol in one night.

I would then calculate the BAC based on different weights of the person and length of time consuming the beverages.

So...any ideas as to what song would get someone the drunkest?  Bonus points for songs that are relevant to teenagers today.",Music,1540519798,Rice_ChrisB,6,1,True,2018-10-25

Smiling in my face
But you know I'ma make em mad
When I pull out the fuckin' moves that I plan
As soon as they shifted
Cause there is one thing about bitches like me that been in the trenches
I lost it all in a second and made it back inconsistently
Simply kicked it into higher gear when they was dissing me

Music by people you know to expand my library,"I really wanted to share one of my friend's bands tracks here, but noticed that friday is for text posts, so thought I would open this up a little bit. I have a friend who plays drums in a couple of bands and I really like their music, obviously they aren't main stream and most won't have heard any of their stuff. I was wondering if anyone else knows of bands like that where you know a member of the band and just want to share their talent? I love listening to new music, so would love to listen to bands you personally know :) I have left two of my favourite songs of my mates band below for those that are curious.

"The Who's ""Quadrophenia"" album is 45 years old today!","Quadrophenia was released on October 26, 1973. Composed entirely by Pete Townshend, the album follows Johnny, a British Mod as he becomes disillusioned with his life. 

Personally, this is my favorite album. It's much more polished than *Tommy*, and I absolutely adore the album's general asthetic. Every song feels like a part of the collective album, yet each can stand on it's own. My personal favorite songs in the album are ""The Real Me"" and ""Doctor Jimmy"".

[Rant] Latino Music,"So as you probably have heard on the radio, seen on TV or watched a 5 second Youtube ad, there has been an increase in cancerous songs over the last couple of years on the world stage of music. I'm talking about latino music.
Latino music has become the cancer of society. For some reason the directors of the music videos are so out of ideas that they use the same setup for almost every video.

About their music, it's pretty much trash. I'm saying this because the songs are repetitive. The beat is the same washed up instrumental which sometimes features an acoustic guitar.
This rant has been written because I'm frustrated of the fact that, being Romanian, I have to listen to this garbage every time I turn up the TV, drive or try to have some chill radio music while doing anything really. I think globally it is not that big of a problem, but in Romania the Balkanic influences have disappeared from mainstream culture and have been substitued by hispanic ones. It's rather sad, especially because, until now, every genre has changed its style and artists have evolved their music, while these hispanic bastards keep milking the music industry with poor made and low budget music.
What is your opinion on this subject?

Matt Berninger of 'The National' explaining the meaning behind 'green gloves' really hit me in the feels.,"‚ÄúGet inside their clothes with my green gloves / Watch their videos in their chairs.‚Äù (‚ÄúGreen Gloves‚Äù)

MB: It was hard to take that song and guide it away from being a stalker song or about somebody breaking and entering or somebody violating someone‚Äôs personal space. It‚Äôs more about trying to remember someone and sort of be them‚Äîsomeone that you‚Äôve lost your connection with (maybe because of a death)‚Äîso you reconnect with them by getting inside their clothes, watching their videos, getting in their bed. You‚Äôre actually recreating them somehow in order to know them better. You miss them so much you have to become them. 

If there‚Äôs someone you absolutely miss, you might find yourself talking to them a lot in your mind, creating those fake conversations with them and you answer yourself in their voice in your head. Maybe it‚Äôs a girlfriend who dumped you or you know someone who died or that sort of thing, you adopt their personality or the memory of who they were as a means of staying close to them. People talk about spirit, but I have this idea that when we die, we‚Äôre gone. All that lives on is our memory and how we affected people, the way we changed people throughout our life. Whether you‚Äôve had a good effect of a bad effect on people, that‚Äôs your afterlife‚Äîthe people who live on after you.

New Technology [Blockchain music services] - How to get regular music fans to join?,"Hi everyone.   


Being both an independent artist and a advocate for the right for independent artist to get a fair share of the value created and also a big interest in new technology I've been quite active in the blockchain music community since the beginning of this year. I tried some different services like Musicoin, Steemit, DSound and Choon.

&amp;#x200B;

From an artist perspective it is a fantastic opportunity to actually make some better money from the work I create and I have been able to connect with lot of other like minded artists.  


One problem we're facing though is how to get the regular listeners interested and therefore I wanted to start a discussion here what it would take for music fans to start using new services where the lion part of the music are from independent and unsigned artists.   


Is there a difference between people with a more ""active"" music taste who search for more obscure music and the regular top 40 listener?  


The question is open and if anyone wanna see what I'm talking about my favorite service so far is Choon and here you can find my profile on there: [https://choon.co/artists/jonmagnusson/](https://choon.co/artists/jonmagnusson/)",Music,1535382796,JonMagnusson,11,4,True,2018-08-27

"Hey, how about we remove the Hall of Fame, have more themed days, *and* change how we block reposts?","Was thinking about how /r/music gets a bad rap from a lot of people. Either the moderation is too harsh, too lax, ""The same songs keep getting reposted"", or any of the multitudes of other complaints. Here's a couple changes I think would be helpful, or at least more interesting. 

This is a default subreddit. It's going to get flooded with reposts. I say, /r/music leans into it a bit. I suggest we have themed days, removal of the Hall of Fame, and change how reposts are governed. I'll go over each point below.

For themed days, I suggest the following...

* *Sundays* **I made this** 

This is the day for everyone to post their own creations

* *Mondays* **Deep Cuts only** 

This day is for songs that were never singles by any artist you like.

* *Tuesdays* **Cover Songs only** 

Any cover by any band. So long as it is a cover, it's cool.

* *Wednesdays* **Feel Good Music**

It's hump day, post your favorite songs. No restrictions.

* *Thursdays* **If I haven't heard it, it's new to me!**

A day for recommending music to others. 

* *Fridays* **New Releases and discussion**

This is the international release day for all music. Let's talk about each album, post songs off the album

* *Saturdays* **Mods are asleep, post X**

Lax moderation this day. As long as it is music based, go nuts.

These themed days would necessitate the removal of the Hall of Fame. But,to ensure the entire front page of /r/music isn't just a wall of the same shit, I'd institute a ""no reposts"" rule that blocks that same song from being reposted for at least two months after it was last posted/garnered more than 100 upvotes.

Recommend some 80s style songs?,"Can anyone recommend songs that sound like they came from the 80s? I mean songs with classic instruments with some synthesizer. Like Vice City's Flash FM, Fever 1.05, Wave 103 compilations and some of the already existing ""remakes"" of modern songs that make them sound like they came out in the 80s.  


Example:   
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq4xhldVpQc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Aq4xhldVpQc)

I think I've found all of the 80s style conversions of modern songs and I'm having a hard time finding more, so suggestions for similar sounding music will be greatly appreciated.   


I don't want any sort of ""retrowave"", it just sounds boring to me, having just the synth effect makes it feel like it lacks variety, it all sounds the same and a lot of it just lacks, idk, soul I guess. There are exceptions of course.

"'Sharp Objects' Music Supervisor Susan Jacobs on Landing Led Zeppelin, Winning an Emmy &amp; Why AMPAS Needs to Step Up"," 

Music supervisor Susan Jacobs is a conduit for catharsis in film. Over the past four decades, the synch savant has leveraged her mighty ear to build a robust legacy as powerful as the films she has selected music for, with standouts including *Capote* (2005), *Little Miss Sunshine* (2006), *Lady in the Water*(2006), *American Hustle* (2013) and¬† *I, Tonya* (2017).¬†

Repeat collaborations with directors¬†David O. Russell (*Silver Linings Playbook, Joy)*, Julian Schnabel (*Basquiat, The Diving Bell and the Butterfly*), and Jean-Marc Vall√©e (*Wild, Big Little Lies)* have led to close friendships, and they continue to tap her for new projects.

Jacobs'¬†most recent credit is the HBO mini-series *Sharp Objects,* starring Amy Adams and based on a 2006 psychological thriller by Gillian Flynn. The series finale airs Sunday night (Aug. 26).¬†The project reunited her with the director, whose impressionistic process she describes as like ‚Äúpainting.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs much more of a basket weave with Jean-Marc, as he‚Äôs cutting pictures right with the music that is all planned out in advance before we shoot,‚Äù Jacobs adds, especially because¬†Vall√©e does not use scores, only licensed tracks. ¬†",Music,1535391300,jenelyngalve,3,4,True,2018-08-27
